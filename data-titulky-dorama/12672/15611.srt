<i>Episode 49</i>

16
00:01:58,450 --> 00:02:01,200
Xiao Fan, you had a nightmare.

17
00:02:02,620 --> 00:02:04,960
Xiang, what are you doing?

18
00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:06,980
Do you know with you knocking me out and bringing me here,

19
00:02:06,980 --> 00:02:09,460
How am I going to explain things to my Sector? <br>How am I going to explain things to my Teacher?

20
00:02:09,460 --> 00:02:12,560
Listen to my explanation. I also had no choice.

21
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:14,930
If you remained there, they would have killed you.

22
00:02:14,930 --> 00:02:17,410
Taoist Dao Xuan is now calling together the 3 Orthodox Sectors.

23
00:02:17,410 --> 00:02:22,880
Including Fenxiang Sector's Yun Yi Lan. They're going to Tong Tian Summit in 3 days to interrogate you.

24
00:02:22,880 --> 00:02:24,290
They don't consider you as their disciple any more.

25
00:02:24,290 --> 00:02:27,880
They want to cast you aside as quickly as possible. Why are you still waiting there for?

26
00:02:30,420 --> 00:02:33,130
You don't understand the significance of my Sector is to me.

27
00:02:34,190 --> 00:02:37,130
Alright, if you want to leave, then leave now.

28
00:02:38,460 --> 00:02:40,920
You're really want to leave?

29
00:02:40,920 --> 00:02:43,450
I don't want Teacher to take the blame for me.

30
00:02:44,430 --> 00:02:47,930
Just wait. It's the Sector Leader who demanded that you were brought back.

31
00:02:47,930 --> 00:02:51,600
Regarding what happened in the past, he has a lot of thing he wants to say to you.

32
00:03:11,810 --> 00:03:16,930
You and Teacher Pu Kong had said before, Tian Yin Sector owes me a debt of gratitude.

33
00:03:16,930 --> 00:03:19,450
Yes, Sector Leader has instructed over and over again.

34
00:03:19,450 --> 00:03:23,860
All disciples of Tian Yin Sect, when they are outside and run into a person named Zhang Xiao Fan from the Qing Yun Sect .

35
00:03:23,860 --> 00:03:27,520
No matter what troubles he's in, they must use their all to help and assist.

36
00:03:27,520 --> 00:03:29,770
Why? What debt of gratitude is owed to me?

37
00:03:29,770 --> 00:03:33,890
That, I'm not too sure of. But when you see my Teacher, he'll tell you himself

38
00:03:59,260 --> 00:04:00,900
You've come.

39
00:04:04,770 --> 00:04:07,600
I (Zhang Xiao Fan from the Qing Yun Sect) have seen Great Master Pu Hong before.

40
00:04:14,360 --> 00:04:17,160
Just to treat me before,

41
00:04:17,160 --> 00:04:20,480
you didn't mind losing some of your cultivation. For this debt,

42
00:04:20,480 --> 00:04:24,480
There no way I can repay you. Please accept my kowtow.

43
00:04:31,690 --> 00:04:35,300
As you said, Tian Yin (Heaven Sky) Pavilion and you have a debt of gratitude.

44
00:04:35,300 --> 00:04:39,540
But do you know that our Tian Yin Pavilion owed you a lot?

45
00:04:39,540 --> 00:04:41,980
In a blink of an eye, it's already seven years.

46
00:04:41,980 --> 00:04:46,520
In this seven years, you kept your promise all throughout.

47
00:04:46,520 --> 00:04:50,360
We in Tian Yin Pavilion has now way to repay you.

48
00:04:50,360 --> 00:04:53,320
Please accept my kowtow.

49
00:04:53,320 --> 00:04:54,790
Great Master.

50
00:05:06,920 --> 00:05:10,060
Everyone says that public clamor can melt metals and

51
00:05:10,060 --> 00:05:13,260
accumulated defamation can melt the bones. No matter if it's during strong winds or waves

52
00:05:13,260 --> 00:05:17,960
or blades or swords are draped (pointed) on your body, Hero Zhang never leaked one word

53
00:05:17,960 --> 00:05:22,620
about the truth about my Junior Brother Bu Zhi.

54
00:05:22,620 --> 00:05:27,890
We owe you a debt of gratitude whose amount is terrifying.

55
00:05:29,860 --> 00:05:33,050
Teacher Pu Zhi saved me and Jing Yu in the past

56
00:05:33,050 --> 00:05:37,780
and even transferred his technique and cultivation to me. In terms of debt, I'm the one who is in debt to him.

57
00:05:38,810 --> 00:05:42,470
Regarding the promise, since I've already swore to Teacher Pu Zhi,

58
00:05:42,470 --> 00:05:47,010
I then decided that I can't tell anyone about this secret.

59
00:05:48,980 --> 00:05:52,640
After Junior Brother Bu Kong came back from the battle at Liu Po Mountain,

60
00:05:52,640 --> 00:05:55,100
he told me about what happened to you.

61
00:05:55,100 --> 00:05:58,120
I already felt that it will not go well.

62
00:05:58,120 --> 00:06:01,080
At this point, I should personally

63
00:06:01,080 --> 00:06:03,940
explain everything to your sect leader Dao Xuan

64
00:06:03,940 --> 00:06:07,020
so I can clean your name.

65
00:06:07,020 --> 00:06:09,120
But before that,

66
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:13,650
I should be the one to tell you first about the whole detail of what happened.

67
00:06:15,720 --> 00:06:19,370
Great Master Pu Hong, what happened that time was something that even Teacher Pu Chi

68
00:06:19,370 --> 00:06:21,340
didn't expect.

69
00:06:21,340 --> 00:06:23,730
Moreover, that time, I'm very young.

70
00:06:23,730 --> 00:06:28,020
I thought that this matter will not be discovered by anyone forever.

71
00:06:28,020 --> 00:06:31,890
But what happened at Liu Po Mountain was very urgent.

72
00:06:31,890 --> 00:06:37,340
I unintentionally used a Tian Yin technique causing a rift between our two sects.

73
00:06:37,340 --> 00:06:39,150
It was me who was inconsiderate.

74
00:06:39,150 --> 00:06:41,570
You still thinking about our sake until now

75
00:06:41,570 --> 00:06:46,430
is really making our whole sect have no face to face you.

76
00:06:46,430 --> 00:06:49,500
If Great Master can explain it, that will be the best.

77
00:06:49,500 --> 00:06:51,350
It's just that it was already so many years ago.

78
00:06:51,350 --> 00:06:56,140
Teacher Pu Zhi has never appeared and never looked for me.

79
00:06:56,140 --> 00:07:00,700
Forgive me for being tact. I'm guessing that Teacher Pu Zhi

80
00:07:00,700 --> 00:07:03,100
must already been dead.

81
00:07:05,430 --> 00:07:09,700
Teacher transferred his technique to me out of good intentions but a freak combination of factors happened.

82
00:07:09,700 --> 00:07:14,620
I had never cleared my name. And I also wouldn't allow that after Teacher's death,

83
00:07:14,620 --> 00:07:16,240
he would still suffer being suspected by his fellow righteous sects.

84
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:20,150
Young hero, to tell you the truth,

85
00:07:21,070 --> 00:07:24,920
what happened that time was not really a freak combination of factors

86
00:07:24,920 --> 00:07:29,810
but were intentionally set up by Junior Brother Pu Zhi.

87
00:07:29,810 --> 00:07:33,160
What? What elder means is?

88
00:07:34,790 --> 00:07:37,980
After the tragic case of Grass Temple Village,

89
00:07:37,980 --> 00:07:41,900
Junior Brother didn't die but instead came back here.

90
00:07:41,900 --> 00:07:46,840
To repent for his sins, he left this heart lamp.

91
00:07:46,840 --> 00:07:51,940
Tormenting day and night for repenting his sins.

92
00:07:51,940 --> 00:07:54,200
It is already seven years.

93
00:07:55,430 --> 00:07:57,090
Repentance?

94
00:07:59,170 --> 00:08:01,510
What sins do Teache Pu Zhi have?

95
00:08:02,550 --> 00:08:08,160
Young hero, do you know where these black smoke came from?

96
00:08:17,340 --> 00:08:22,140
This is...the Energy of the Imaginary Demon.

97
00:08:22,140 --> 00:08:26,400
<i>That magic treasure needs blood as its sacrificial offering. The more people you kill,</i>

98
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:29,990
<i>the more powerful its energy become. It innately eats blood.</i>

99
00:08:29,990 --> 00:08:33,380
<i>As long as you don't stop killing people, it will become more and more powerful.</i>

100
00:08:33,380 --> 00:08:36,350
<i>Only by that can your magical power increase.</i>

101
00:08:36,350 --> 00:08:38,320
It is indeed the Heart Demon.

102
00:08:39,240 --> 00:08:43,160
And all of these can be explained starting several years ago.

103
00:08:45,080 --> 00:08:49,100
The Junior Brother Pu Zhi that time can be considered as Tian Yin Pavilion's most talented disciple

104
00:08:49,100 --> 00:08:51,840
within several hundred years.

105
00:08:51,840 --> 00:08:58,640
He traveled far and vast to investigate the whereabouts of the evil sects.

106
00:08:58,640 --> 00:09:01,470
Accidentally, through fate and coincidence,

107
00:09:01,470 --> 00:09:05,390
on the Western Swamp where the ancient battle between the righteous and the evil sect happened,

108
00:09:05,390 --> 00:09:10,110
he accidentally obtained a magical treasure with extremely powerful evil spirit.

109
00:09:10,110 --> 00:09:14,540
It is the Blood Capturing Pearl that is in your hands now.

110
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:22,510
It now recognizes you as its master.

111
00:09:22,510 --> 00:09:26,500
Junior Brother Pu Kong recognized it while he was at the forest in a deep valley

112
00:09:26,500 --> 00:09:29,530
and that you were that Zhang Xiao Fan.

113
00:09:29,530 --> 00:09:34,780
Never thought that after several years, you still kept it by your side.

114
00:09:37,660 --> 00:09:42,560
Teacher Pu Zhi told me that time to look for a deserted place and then throw it out.

115
00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:47,600
But...I still decided to continue keeping it by my side.

116
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:49,860
Young Hero doesn't need to brood over it.

117
00:09:49,860 --> 00:09:52,350
Being able to assume ownership of a magical item belonging to the evil sect,

118
00:09:52,350 --> 00:09:54,960
in this world, only you ever did it.

119
00:09:54,960 --> 00:09:59,020
For the righteous and evil sect, it can be considered as a good news.

120
00:09:59,020 --> 00:10:05,290
Magical item doesn't have a good or bad distinction to begin with. But before you are able to transform it from training...

121
00:10:06,610 --> 00:10:10,630
The Blood Capturing Pearl came from the evil sect,

122
00:10:10,630 --> 00:10:14,180
specifically from old man Hei Xin (Blackheart), the leader of Lie Xie Sect.

123
00:10:14,180 --> 00:10:18,010
On it is a very strong amount of evil energy.

124
00:10:19,890 --> 00:10:24,070
Junior Brother don't want it to harm the people so he made a grand wish.

125
00:10:24,070 --> 00:10:27,760
<i>He then used our sect's magical treasured weapon, the Jaded Beads, to suppress it.</i>

126
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:29,990
<i>He also used a Tian Yin secret technique</i>

127
00:10:29,990 --> 00:10:35,400
<i>and through his own cultivation to transform the evil spirit within the Blood Capturing Pearl.</i>

128
00:10:35,400 --> 00:10:37,100
<i>That time, Junior Brother still has another wish.</i>

129
00:10:37,100 --> 00:10:39,830
<i>That is to solve the mystery of longevity.</i>

130
00:10:39,830 --> 00:10:44,350
<i>He mastered the secret techniques of our sect then went to Qing Yun Sect</i>

131
00:10:44,350 --> 00:10:48,740
<i>and visited your Sect Leader Dao Xun, hoping that a disicple</i>

132
00:10:48,740 --> 00:10:53,890
<i>could learn both Qing Yun and Tian Yung magic.</i>

133
00:10:58,590 --> 00:11:01,760
Teacher Pu Zhi went to Qing Yun?

134
00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:04,200
Yes. Junior Brother Pu Zhi's way of thinking

135
00:11:04,200 --> 00:11:07,770
<i>was courteously rejected by Master Dao Xuan.</i>

136
00:11:07,770 --> 00:11:12,450
<i>Not long afterwards, on the way down the mountain, he was attacked.</i>

137
00:11:12,450 --> 00:11:14,490
<i>He was seriously injured.</i>

138
00:11:31,940 --> 00:11:36,900
When I saw Teacher Pu Zhi at Grass Temple Village, he was already injured.

139
00:11:36,900 --> 00:11:43,110
That's right. When you first met him, it was the second day after he went down the mountain.

140
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:02,870
<i>Temple of the Earth God.</i>

141
00:12:04,810 --> 00:12:10,030
<i>Keeping the Capturing Blood Pearl by his side for a long time would definitely affect Junior Brother.</i>

142
00:12:10,030 --> 00:12:14,010
<i>Magnifying his hatred, grudges, and desire.</i>

143
00:12:14,010 --> 00:12:17,560
<i>After leaving Qing Yun, Junior Brother has developed displeasing thoughts to begin with.</i>

144
00:12:17,560 --> 00:12:22,780
<i>Adding the fact that he was attacked sneakily afterwards, his mental state became muddled. Junior Brother knew that something was wrong.</i>

145
00:12:22,780 --> 00:12:25,390
<i>He could only hide in Grass Temple Village</i>

146
00:12:25,390 --> 00:12:29,760
<i>and use power to heal himself while suppressing the Capturing Blood Pearl's power.</i>

147
00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:34,590
<i> Who would have thought that staying for one night would create unchangeable consequences?</i>

148
00:12:34,590 --> 00:12:35,960
<i>It's precisely during that night</i>

149
00:12:35,960 --> 00:12:40,130
<i>that the mysterious black clothed person, on Lin Jing Yu,</i>

150
00:12:40,130 --> 00:12:43,440
<i>put the poisonous Seven Tail magic.</i>

151
00:12:44,520 --> 00:12:47,990
<i>Junior Brother couldn't watch the child die from poison.</i>

152
00:12:47,990 --> 00:12:50,560
<i>Naturally, he did his best to help.</i>

153
00:12:50,560 --> 00:12:54,900
<i>When Junior Brother had used much of his cultivation, that black clothed person</i>

154
00:12:54,900 --> 00:12:56,530
<i>attacked again</i>

155
00:12:56,530 --> 00:13:01,360
<i>to steal Junior Brother's Capturing Blood Pearl. Junior Brother was seriously poisoned,</i>

156
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:03,770
<i>and was injured in the end by the black clothed person.</i>

157
00:13:03,770 --> 00:13:07,030
<i>So in the end, Junior Brother used our sect's magic to pierce through the mysterious person.</i>

158
00:13:07,030 --> 00:13:09,660
<i>He caused him to flee because of the injury.</i>

159
00:13:09,660 --> 00:13:13,730
<i>Afterwards, he knew that he would surely die. But the cultivation techniques in this world</i>

160
00:13:13,730 --> 00:13:17,650
<i>although came from different paths will have the same destination. His dream of converging different cultivation techniques</i>

161
00:13:17,650 --> 00:13:21,770
<i>had not yet been fulfilled, so it was difficult for him to give up.</i>

162
00:13:21,770 --> 00:13:25,710
<i>Hence, he developed the wildest idea.</i>

163
00:13:25,710 --> 00:13:30,780
<i>Before he died, he transferred all his cultivation to a child.</i>

164
00:13:30,780 --> 00:13:35,930
<i>Then he had that child enter Qing Yun and learn Qing Yun magic.</i>

165
00:13:35,930 --> 00:13:40,560
<i>That way, the two Qing Yun and Tian Ying magic that never mixed together</i>

166
00:13:40,560 --> 00:13:44,450
<i>would work together on the same person's body.</i>

167
00:13:44,450 --> 00:13:47,810
<i>His wish would be fulfilled that way.</i>

168
00:13:47,810 --> 00:13:50,420
<i>He was afraid that if the demon sect member came back again</i>

169
00:13:50,420 --> 00:13:53,300
<i>then he would have no way to protect the Blood Capturing Pearl again.</i>

170
00:13:53,300 --> 00:13:57,130
<i>So he gave you the pearl as well.</i>

171
00:13:57,130 --> 00:14:02,830
<i>He wanted you to find an empty place to destroy it. But you valued past affections</i>

172
00:14:02,830 --> 00:14:07,670
<i>and kept it until today. Although that's the case, it was also because he was reckless and rash</i>

173
00:14:07,670 --> 00:14:12,620
<i>and didn't expect it. He carried the Blood Capturing Pearl for so many years.</i>

174
00:14:12,620 --> 00:14:15,730
<i>Unknowingly, it already started to transform</i>

175
00:14:15,730 --> 00:14:18,460
and attached to his body that by the time he was on the verge of dying

176
00:14:18,460 --> 00:14:21,990
after being injured from the battle, he suddenly thought of

177
00:14:21,990 --> 00:14:25,670
and feared that you might not be able to join Qing Yun Sect.

178
00:14:25,670 --> 00:14:27,740
He was controlled by the evil power.

179
00:14:27,740 --> 00:14:31,710
He thought to kill all the people in Grass Temple Village.

180
00:14:31,710 --> 00:14:35,050
Then, because you two had become orphans, the Qing Yun Sect

181
00:14:35,050 --> 00:14:39,510
would take you into their sect. And so...

182
00:15:18,090 --> 00:15:20,500
The one that took Xiao Fan away, his magic

183
00:15:20,500 --> 00:15:24,430
had a golden light. Xue Qi suspects it is Tian Ying magic.

184
00:15:24,430 --> 00:15:26,520
That day at Qing Yun,

185
00:15:26,520 --> 00:15:28,380
besides someone called Pu Fang,

186
00:15:28,380 --> 00:15:32,130
there was also a young Tian Ying disciple called Ah Xiang.

187
00:15:32,130 --> 00:15:36,810
They say he is the Tian Ying Sect Leader's best disciple.

188
00:15:36,810 --> 00:15:39,330
Ah Xiang is indeed a Tian Ying disciple.

189
00:15:39,330 --> 00:15:42,440
We met him at Yudu.

190
00:15:42,440 --> 00:15:46,180
He owns a lot of hotels in Yudu, he's our good friend.

191
00:15:46,180 --> 00:15:50,880
Jing Yu, after you and Xiao Fan were brought back to Qing Yun,

192
00:15:50,880 --> 00:15:54,470
you've never had contact with Tian Ying disciples.

193
00:15:54,470 --> 00:15:57,710
That means that Ah Xiang didn't have a chance

194
00:15:57,710 --> 00:16:00,320
to give Xiao Fan any magic.

195
00:16:01,410 --> 00:16:03,320
There probably wasn't.

196
00:16:03,320 --> 00:16:07,460
In Yudu, Xiao Fan was always busy defeating the evil sects.

197
00:16:07,460 --> 00:16:10,550
He couldn't have learned another sect's magic.

198
00:16:10,550 --> 00:16:13,850
That means, Xiao Fan's Tian Ying magic

199
00:16:13,850 --> 00:16:18,810
was learned before he entered Qing Yun.

200
00:16:18,810 --> 00:16:22,990
The day Grass Temple Village was destroyed, I went to visit an old friend.

201
00:16:23,780 --> 00:16:28,070
After I returned, I heard that Tian Ying Peak's Taoist Pu Zhi

202
00:16:28,070 --> 00:16:30,530
had once come to visit Qing Yun.

203
00:16:30,530 --> 00:16:34,590
Based on the timing, it should be that day the incident happened.

204
00:16:34,590 --> 00:16:39,730
No one told me why Taoist Pu Zhi came here to visit,

205
00:16:39,730 --> 00:16:45,560
but I think he must have to pass by Grass Temple Village on the way down the mountain.

206
00:16:45,560 --> 00:16:48,630
Jing Yu, think carefully.

207
00:16:48,630 --> 00:16:52,020
Before Grass Temple Village was destroyed, did you see any

208
00:16:52,020 --> 00:16:54,800
mysterious unknown people?

209
00:17:01,630 --> 00:17:03,030
I did!

210
00:17:51,970 --> 00:17:56,590
Young Mistress, Zhang Xiao Fan won't come here!

211
00:17:56,590 --> 00:17:58,390
Or else he'd be too stupid!

212
00:17:58,390 --> 00:18:01,610
I know. I just came to take a look.

213
00:18:06,800 --> 00:18:09,830
<i>In the past, Junior Brother met a strange person.</i>

214
00:18:09,830 --> 00:18:13,990
He also obtained a mystical medicine, the Guaranteed Death in Three Days pill.

215
00:18:13,990 --> 00:18:19,790
<i>After taking this medicine, all your body's capabilities will be stimulated within 3 days.</i>

216
00:18:19,790 --> 00:18:24,350
Once the deadline comes, he'd definitely die.

217
00:18:26,730 --> 00:18:30,970
Within three days, Junior Brother rushed back to Tian Ying Peak

218
00:18:30,970 --> 00:18:34,210
and told me everything that had happened.

219
00:18:34,210 --> 00:18:36,960
He was clear minded then.

220
00:18:36,960 --> 00:18:40,760
He regretted the terrible crime he committed then.

221
00:18:40,760 --> 00:18:44,030
<i>Even if he dies a thousand times, it wouldn't be enough to make up for this one time.</i>

222
00:18:44,030 --> 00:18:47,070
<i>He then created a heart lamp from his remaining energy.</i>

223
00:18:47,070 --> 00:18:52,500
Within these 7 years, he endured the torment of the heart demon.

224
00:18:52,500 --> 00:18:57,000
That's what happened that day.

225
00:18:57,000 --> 00:19:00,100
If those of the righteous side enter the evil side,

226
00:19:00,100 --> 00:19:02,950
then there will be unchangeable consequences resulting.

227
00:19:02,950 --> 00:19:05,990
Tian Ying Peak couldn't save him.

228
00:19:05,990 --> 00:19:11,380
I hope that after you find out the truth you can...

229
00:19:13,370 --> 00:19:18,490
At the right time, we surely will clearly explain this matter to Qing Yun Sect

230
00:19:18,490 --> 00:19:23,160
to make them stop blaming you.

231
00:19:27,890 --> 00:19:33,800
Blaming? Who blamed me?

232
00:19:48,280 --> 00:19:51,660
Calm down hero, don't let the evil object control you!

233
00:20:15,910 --> 00:20:18,720
Evil object control me?

234
00:20:20,180 --> 00:20:26,520
What is evil? It's you? Or is itme?

235
00:20:26,520 --> 00:20:32,930
What is righteous? What is the righteous goal? Stop lying to me!

236
00:20:34,970 --> 00:20:37,590
To protect this secret,

237
00:20:37,590 --> 00:20:40,160
I've been painfully enduring it all!

238
00:20:42,260 --> 00:20:47,820
Me? What do I count for?

239
00:20:47,820 --> 00:20:52,550
What do I count for? What do I count for?

240
00:20:52,550 --> 00:20:55,800
What do I count for?!

241
00:21:06,810 --> 00:21:09,430
I am willing to take on my junior brother's crime.

242
00:21:09,430 --> 00:21:12,870
I hope you will not let the evil heart demon triumph.

243
00:21:12,870 --> 00:21:19,120
Or else, you'll fall into the evil side just like my junior brother, with no hope of reprieve!

244
00:21:19,120 --> 00:21:22,920
No hope of reprieve? Fall into the evil side?

245
00:21:22,920 --> 00:21:26,670
No hope of reprieve? Fall into the evil side?

246
00:21:26,670 --> 00:21:33,410
Fall into the evil side!!!

247
00:23:07,410 --> 00:23:12,010
<i>Zhang Xiao Fan, why do you want to enter Qing Yun?</i>

248
00:23:13,040 --> 00:23:15,900
<i>To get revenge for my parents and my villagers!</i>

249
00:23:15,900 --> 00:23:19,530
<i>Such a healthy boy but not aiming to better oneself.</i>

250
00:23:19,530 --> 00:23:23,200
<i>You are full of revenge and hatred!</i>

251
00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:27,380
<i>What difference is that from the one who destroyed your village?</i>

252
00:23:28,220 --> 00:23:32,430
<i>You live for getting revenge instead of protecting this world!</i>

253
00:23:32,430 --> 00:23:36,990
<i>This sort of person, I won't take him as my disciple.</i>

254
00:23:36,990 --> 00:23:41,630
<i>you must have a heart for the world and live for the living,</i>

255
00:23:41,630 --> 00:23:45,890
<i>to think on behalf of the world, to create peace for everyone!</i>

256
00:23:48,120 --> 00:23:51,250
<i>But after I went down the mountain, what I experienced</i>

257
00:23:51,250 --> 00:23:56,710
<i>are that righteous and evil sects are rivals and that humans and monsters are of different paths.</i>

258
00:23:57,990 --> 00:24:03,250
<i>The killing spree and tragedies that result from this world's prejudice.</i>

259
00:24:17,910 --> 00:24:22,840
<i>Hatred just cycles repeatedly and is never ending.</i>

260
00:24:30,130 --> 00:24:35,520
<i>Even if this world is any crueler, it still has those that I value</i>

261
00:24:35,520 --> 00:24:41,450
<i>and protect. My family, brothers, </i>

262
00:24:41,450 --> 00:24:46,000
<i>friends. The one that I love.</i>

263
00:24:55,800 --> 00:25:01,650
<i>I cannot live to get revenge. I can't.</i>

264
00:25:06,830 --> 00:25:10,320
Xiao Fan. Xiao Fan?

265
00:25:16,730 --> 00:25:20,000
Teacher said I can bring you back at any time.

266
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:23,590
Junior Master Pu Kong is still at Qing Yun. During the joint trial,

267
00:25:23,590 --> 00:25:25,860
he will personally clarify the situation.

268
00:25:28,320 --> 00:25:30,560
When did you know about my things?

269
00:25:31,710 --> 00:25:35,420
Actually, when Junior Master Pu Zhi came back here,

270
00:25:35,420 --> 00:25:37,670
I was at Teacher's side to help.

271
00:25:37,670 --> 00:25:40,880
I was just too young then, so I wasn't very sure what was going on.

272
00:25:40,880 --> 00:25:44,160
I slowly remembered it all when I met you later.

273
00:25:45,270 --> 00:25:50,320
But I only understood the rest when I came back and asked Teacher.

274
00:25:51,460 --> 00:25:57,100
Xiao Fan, I'm sorry. Our Tian Ying Peak owes you too much.

275
00:25:59,460 --> 00:26:01,670
So what if you owe a lot?

276
00:26:03,130 --> 00:26:05,700
So what if I suffer a lot?

277
00:26:08,960 --> 00:26:12,030
There's no way to turn any of that back.

278
00:26:15,920 --> 00:26:17,590
Xiao Fan!

279
00:26:56,360 --> 00:26:57,850
Teacher.

280
00:27:00,400 --> 00:27:04,600
I remember, you once had me call you that.

281
00:27:07,100 --> 00:27:09,300
You gave me magic.

282
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:14,000
But you destroyed my family and friends.

283
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:16,600
You killed my parents.

284
00:27:17,800 --> 00:27:20,400
You gave me the Capturing Blood Pearl.

285
00:27:20,400 --> 00:27:24,000
You gave me the chance to enter the Qing Yun Sect.

286
00:27:25,400 --> 00:27:29,600
Yet you also had me cast aside by the whole Qing Yun Sect.

287
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:33,700
I hate you.

288
00:27:35,800 --> 00:27:38,400
But I must thank you.

289
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:43,400
That year when Jing Yu was injured,

290
00:27:43,400 --> 00:27:47,000
you didn't have to save him.

291
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:50,000
But in the end you still saved him.

292
00:27:51,800 --> 00:27:54,000
Afterwards, everything

293
00:27:55,400 --> 00:27:58,100
started because of that.

294
00:28:04,800 --> 00:28:07,500
During these seven years of pain,

295
00:28:08,200 --> 00:28:11,200
everything was enough.

296
00:28:13,400 --> 00:28:18,600
Today, let everything finish.

297
00:28:50,600 --> 00:28:52,200
Xiao Fan!

298
00:28:53,800 --> 00:28:57,500
Xiao Fan! Xiao Fan!

299
00:28:59,400 --> 00:29:03,100
Xiao Fan! Xiao Fan!

300
00:29:20,200 --> 00:29:22,300
<i>-Don't run!<br>-Come capture me!</i>

301
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:32,000
<i> Timing & subitles brought to you by Gone with the Shirt Team@Viki </i>

302
00:29:33,800 --> 00:29:36,400
<i>Mother, I'm going out to play!</i>

303
00:29:36,400 --> 00:29:38,400
<i>Xiao Fan, come back early to eat dinner!</i>

304
00:29:38,400 --> 00:29:40,600
<i>I got it!</i>

305
00:29:47,800 --> 00:29:49,200
Who's there?

306
00:31:22,600 --> 00:31:24,600
<i>It's been seven years.</i>

307
00:31:26,200 --> 00:31:30,500
<i>We finally meet. Zhang Xiao Fan.</i>

308
00:31:31,600 --> 00:31:33,200
It's you?

309
00:31:33,200 --> 00:31:36,100
You killed my family!

310
00:31:50,770 --> 00:31:52,520
<i>Disciple.</i>

311
00:31:54,600 --> 00:31:57,200
<i>Have you been well?</i>

312
00:31:57,200 --> 00:32:01,800
<i>In these years, I've been tortured so much.</i>

313
00:32:01,800 --> 00:32:06,000
<i>The Qing Yun Sect, Tian Ying Peak.</i>

314
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:09,000
<i>The seed they planted that year</i>

315
00:32:09,020 --> 00:32:12,820
<i>became a big forest now.</i>

316
00:32:12,820 --> 00:32:15,190
<i>I want to see</i>

317
00:32:15,200 --> 00:32:17,800
<i>my life's obsession</i>

318
00:32:17,800 --> 00:32:21,800
<i>if it can be fulfilled on your body.</i>

319
00:32:21,800 --> 00:32:24,200
You're not Teacher Pu Zhi!

320
00:32:24,200 --> 00:32:26,600
You're a heart demon.

321
00:32:27,800 --> 00:32:31,200
I'm going to kill you! Die!

322
00:32:50,400 --> 00:32:52,400
<i>He killed your family.</i>

323
00:32:52,400 --> 00:32:56,200
<i>He destroyed your village. Why aren't you getting revenge?</i>

324
00:32:56,200 --> 00:33:00,000
<i>In this world, no one trusts you anymore.</i>

325
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:02,600
<i>So what if it is Qing Yun's magical technique?</i>

326
00:33:02,600 --> 00:33:05,000
<i>So what if it is evil sect dissident magic?</i>

327
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:07,800
<i>They're the same! The same!</i>

328
00:33:07,800 --> 00:33:11,400
<i>Kill! Kill!</i>

329
00:33:11,400 --> 00:33:14,600
<i>Where are you?</i> Xiao Fan where are you?

330
00:33:14,600 --> 00:33:16,400
<i>Xiao Fan!</i>

331
00:33:16,400 --> 00:33:21,200
<i>Xiao Fan! I don't know where you are. But you must hang in there!</i>

332
00:33:21,200 --> 00:33:23,800
If you can hear me, then come back!

333
00:33:23,800 --> 00:33:27,600
<i>-Those wolves wearing sheep clothing are trying to harm you!</i><br>-Bi Yao? Bi Yao!

334
00:33:27,600 --> 00:33:31,000
If you get captured, you don't need to be afraid of being alone!

335
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:35,800
<i>Even if it is death, I'm going to die with you!</i>

336
00:33:36,600 --> 00:33:39,900
<i>Xiao Fan! Xiao Fan!</i>

337
00:33:57,400 --> 00:33:59,600
Teacher Pu Zhi.

338
00:34:01,800 --> 00:34:06,700
<i>It's been seven years. Zhang Xiao Fan.</i>

339
00:34:06,700 --> 00:34:09,400
<i>I didn't think that this Capturing Blood Pearl</i>

340
00:34:09,400 --> 00:34:12,500
<i>would still be by your side.</i>

341
00:34:14,500 --> 00:34:19,400
<i>I was trapped by this evil object, my conscience ruined.</i>

342
00:34:19,400 --> 00:34:22,200
<i>My obsession was great.</i>

343
00:34:22,200 --> 00:34:25,600
<i>In the end, I wasn't able to escape the net of my desire.</i>

344
00:34:25,600 --> 00:34:28,200
<i>But in your hands, it</i>

345
00:34:28,200 --> 00:34:31,000
<i>can be used by you.</i>

346
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:35,200
<i>From this one can see that you have a magnanimous heart.</i>

347
00:34:35,200 --> 00:34:40,000
<i>I admit that I am inferior to you. You fulfilled</i>

348
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:43,200
<i>what I didn't in the past.</i>

349
00:34:43,200 --> 00:34:45,000
Teacher Pu Zhi.

350
00:34:46,400 --> 00:34:48,700
You can escape now.

351
00:34:53,800 --> 00:34:56,600
<i>In this life, my sins are grave.</i>

352
00:34:56,600 --> 00:34:59,100
<i>But in the end, I was able to get your benevolence and righteousness</i>

353
00:34:59,100 --> 00:35:04,500
<i>and break out from here. I don't have anymore regrets in this life.</i>

354
00:36:57,000 --> 00:36:59,800
Young hero has such benevolence

355
00:36:59,800 --> 00:37:03,400
and helped free my Junior Brother that has been tormented by his heart's demon.

356
00:37:03,430 --> 00:37:09,600
The entire Tian Ying Peak thanks you.

357
00:37:11,200 --> 00:37:13,600
The dead cannot come back to life.

358
00:37:15,600 --> 00:37:18,000
If you care too much about the past,

359
00:37:19,200 --> 00:37:21,600
Besides staying in hell,

360
00:37:21,600 --> 00:37:25,600
you'll be tortured for life.

361
00:37:26,400 --> 00:37:28,500
What use is that?

362
00:37:31,400 --> 00:37:33,800
I have a request.

363
00:37:33,800 --> 00:37:36,600
Please let me know.

364
00:37:37,600 --> 00:37:39,000
Please go ahead.

365
00:37:40,400 --> 00:37:42,200
All of these events

366
00:37:42,200 --> 00:37:45,200
started because of Teacher Pu Zhi.

367
00:37:45,200 --> 00:37:48,600
But I feel like there's a reason behind all this.

368
00:37:48,600 --> 00:37:53,600
Now that the dissension between our two sects have been sowed. One person can't have two teachers.

369
00:37:53,600 --> 00:37:56,400
Junior Brother gave you magic

370
00:37:56,400 --> 00:38:00,600
but it was due to selfish reasons. His acts were shameful for a teacher.

371
00:38:00,600 --> 00:38:04,700
You don't have to call him that.

372
00:38:06,800 --> 00:38:10,800
One day as teacher, a lifetime as father.

373
00:38:10,800 --> 00:38:13,200
Even if my teacher knew,

374
00:38:13,200 --> 00:38:16,600
I believe he'd understand my heart's wish.

375
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:20,400
Teacher Pu Zhi wasn't a bad person.

376
00:38:20,400 --> 00:38:25,100
In the end, it's because at Grass Temple Village that day,

377
00:38:25,100 --> 00:38:28,000
Jing Yu was ambushed.

378
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:30,400
To treat his injury, Teacher Pu Zhi

379
00:38:30,400 --> 00:38:32,500
was attacked by his enemy.

380
00:38:33,400 --> 00:38:37,400
When he returned here, did Teacher Pu Zhi mention

381
00:38:37,400 --> 00:38:40,060
who ambushed him?

382
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:45,800
The one who ambushed Pu Zhi

383
00:38:45,800 --> 00:38:48,600
is very possibly at Qing Yun Mountain.

384
00:38:48,600 --> 00:38:50,600
Because only our sect's members

385
00:38:50,600 --> 00:38:55,400
can find out Pu Zhi's movements that day.

386
00:38:55,400 --> 00:38:58,400
You're saying that the demon sect people

387
00:38:58,400 --> 00:39:01,400
had already hidden in Qing Yun Sect since then?

388
00:39:01,400 --> 00:39:04,800
Senior Brother. Do you still remember

389
00:39:04,800 --> 00:39:10,400
that after Xiao Fan entered the sect, he was attacked twice by a masked man?

390
00:39:11,790 --> 00:39:13,390
<i>Xiao Fan!</i>

391
00:39:30,790 --> 00:39:36,210
We guessed then that the masked person was from the Lie Xie Sect.

392
00:39:36,210 --> 00:39:40,250
Later, that person also abducted Tian Ling Er.

393
00:39:40,250 --> 00:39:43,660
That's why the battle at Bi Huo Tian Ice River occured.

394
00:39:43,660 --> 00:39:46,480
I thought that at first too.

395
00:39:46,480 --> 00:39:49,670
After Boss Nian was killed, logically,

396
00:39:49,670 --> 00:39:53,290
the Lie Xie Sect demons should have all been destroyed.

397
00:39:53,290 --> 00:39:57,250
The remaining disciples just scattered after the main tree has fallen.

398
00:39:57,250 --> 00:40:00,700
After that, Xiao Fan didn't take half a step out of Da Zhu Palace.

399
00:40:00,700 --> 00:40:04,640
At the most, he went to the back mountain to learn magic.

400
00:40:05,790 --> 00:40:09,190
Until...the Seven Palace Martial Arts Competition.

401
00:40:09,190 --> 00:40:12,330
That's right. Until the martial arts competition,

402
00:40:12,330 --> 00:40:14,780
the demon sect spy appeared once again.

403
00:40:14,780 --> 00:40:19,560
The Seven Palace Martial Arts Competition. I feel like it's related somehow.

404
00:40:20,890 --> 00:40:23,370
But it's not that beast person.

405
00:40:23,370 --> 00:40:27,670
Young hero, do not panic. I heard Junior Brother once say

406
00:40:27,670 --> 00:40:30,420
that the one who attacked him that night

407
00:40:30,420 --> 00:40:35,430
seemed to have used a profound lightning that can move the horizon.

408
00:40:35,430 --> 00:40:37,490
Profound lighting?

409
00:40:37,490 --> 00:40:40,300
But Senior Brother, talk about the spy

410
00:40:40,300 --> 00:40:43,720
made me think of something.

411
00:40:43,720 --> 00:40:49,390
During the trip to Liubo Mountain, the evil sects set continuous traps for us.

412
00:40:49,390 --> 00:40:53,270
Didn't you guys say that you thought that Ghost King is deceptive

413
00:40:53,270 --> 00:40:57,160
and wanted to use Zhang Xiao Fan's crime to muddle you all?

414
00:40:57,160 --> 00:41:00,700
That was the evil sect's plan

415
00:41:00,700 --> 00:41:03,830
to create suspicion among us. The real trap

416
00:41:03,830 --> 00:41:06,370
was set up behind Kui Niu

417
00:41:06,370 --> 00:41:11,760
when the Ghost King lured us into his trap.

418
00:41:11,760 --> 00:41:15,020
You guys set up a magical formation near Kui Niu's location?

419
00:41:15,020 --> 00:41:19,030
Exactly. This magical formation was initially to trap Kui Niu and

420
00:41:19,030 --> 00:41:21,780
to prevent the evil sect members from escaping.

421
00:41:21,780 --> 00:41:27,030
We didn't succeed in the end, and it became a cage trapping ourselves instead.

422
00:41:27,030 --> 00:41:30,030
Who was there at that time?

423
00:41:30,030 --> 00:41:35,350
Cang Song. Shui Yue. Lu Xue Qi. Da Ren.

424
00:41:35,350 --> 00:41:39,400
And Ling Er too. As well as a large group of younger juniors.

425
00:41:40,440 --> 00:41:42,260
Profound lightning?

426
00:41:54,940 --> 00:41:57,740
It's the Lightning Riding Magical Sword Chant!

427
00:41:57,740 --> 00:41:59,480
What?

428
00:41:59,480 --> 00:42:02,790
Isn't that Qing Yun's highest level of sword magic?

429
00:42:03,940 --> 00:42:08,710
I can't be wrong. I saw Senior Sister Lu use it once.

430
00:42:11,520 --> 00:42:17,130
But seven years ago, she was still young. She couldn't be the mysterious person.

431
00:42:17,130 --> 00:42:20,630
In your sect, who else knows this sword skill?

432
00:42:23,600 --> 00:42:28,610
Besides Senior Sister Lu...it's the elders.

433
00:42:29,930 --> 00:42:34,380
Or perhaps the Sect Leader. Oh no!

434
00:42:37,970 --> 00:42:44,950
