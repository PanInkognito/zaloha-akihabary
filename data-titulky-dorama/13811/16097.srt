15
00:03:30,600 --> 00:03:33,750
Sister Ping Er. The embroidery shop's business is booming now.

16
00:03:33,750 --> 00:03:35,640
They've opened many other shops now!

17
00:03:35,640 --> 00:03:39,080
Sister Ding Ling and the others are living well. They're waiting for you to go back.

18
00:03:39,080 --> 00:03:42,520
Xiao Huan, I can't go back.

19
00:03:42,520 --> 00:03:44,810
Why? Is the demon sect

20
00:03:44,810 --> 00:03:48,010
really better than the embroidery shop?

21
00:03:48,010 --> 00:03:52,200
You don't understand. I'll bring trouble to everyone if I go back.

22
00:03:52,200 --> 00:03:55,100
Why didn't your grandpa come with you this time?

23
00:03:55,100 --> 00:03:57,340
Ah, he went out to visit a friend.

24
00:03:57,340 --> 00:04:00,670
Shu Shu got Qing Yun's letter, and guessed Xiao-

25
00:04:00,670 --> 00:04:05,640
that Brother Guili would come to, so we came over.

26
00:04:05,640 --> 00:04:09,680
Don't follow him anymore.

27
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:11,780
If you're with him, if you run into a strong enemy,

28
00:04:11,780 --> 00:04:15,180
he'll still have to look after your safety. You'll only drag each other down.

29
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:19,870
His life is tough, don't worry.

30
00:04:20,790 --> 00:04:23,480
I think we should take you back.

31
00:05:07,550 --> 00:05:10,290
Let's rest here for now.

32
00:05:10,290 --> 00:05:11,810
Why are we stopping?

33
00:05:11,810 --> 00:05:14,570
It's rare to find a spot without poisonous mist. Isn't it better for us to fly over on our swords?

34
00:05:14,570 --> 00:05:16,260
We have to wait for Jing Yu and Shu Shu to return.

35
00:05:16,260 --> 00:05:18,600
Besides, we fought with the Long Life Sect in the past,

36
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:21,510
and we traveled for so long today. It's time to take a breather.

37
00:05:21,510 --> 00:05:24,170
You doing this will just drag us all down.

38
00:05:24,170 --> 00:05:27,670
If the demon sects enter before us, then what?

39
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:30,620
Qing Yun disciples must go and retreat together.

40
00:05:30,620 --> 00:05:32,830
Your sect can't even deal with your own problems.

41
00:05:32,830 --> 00:05:36,390
You even need others to come save you. I think you should just go back!

42
00:05:36,390 --> 00:05:38,670
You can go and fly ahead.

43
00:05:38,670 --> 00:05:42,640
Junior Sister! Don't talk with them anymore. Let them go.

44
00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:45,300
Junior Sister.

45
00:05:45,300 --> 00:05:47,070
Senior Brother!

46
00:05:49,770 --> 00:05:51,940
Why should we care about them? Let's go first!

47
00:05:51,940 --> 00:05:54,360
We don't know how many monsters are ahead.

48
00:05:54,360 --> 00:05:56,650
The evil sect people are full of sinister schemes.

49
00:05:56,650 --> 00:05:58,140
We cannot go on alone.

50
00:05:58,140 --> 00:05:59,740
I-!

51
00:07:42,660 --> 00:07:44,460
Jing Ping Er?

52
00:07:47,020 --> 00:07:48,530
Jing Ping Er! Let go of Xiao Huan!

53
00:07:48,530 --> 00:07:51,240
Young City Chief. Long time no see. Have you been well?

54
00:07:51,240 --> 00:07:53,000
If you demon sect members don't create trouble,

55
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,600
naturally, I'd be at peace.

56
00:07:54,600 --> 00:07:58,040
Xiao Huan isn't useful to the demon sect. Why did you capture her?

57
00:07:58,040 --> 00:07:59,210
-You-!<br>-That did not happen.

58
00:07:59,210 --> 00:08:00,810
We ran into her on the way.

59
00:08:00,810 --> 00:08:03,160
We caught up for a bit. We were just about to take her away from here.

60
00:08:03,160 --> 00:08:04,640
You ran into her on the road?

61
00:08:04,640 --> 00:08:07,440
I don't think you came here to take a casual walk.

62
00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:10,950
Who will you attack after the Long Life Sect?

63
00:08:10,950 --> 00:08:13,370
Everyone took care of me when I was in Yudu.

64
00:08:13,370 --> 00:08:15,730
I won't attack people I owe a favor to.

65
00:08:17,780 --> 00:08:20,550
We aren't friends now, and take opposite positions.

66
00:08:20,550 --> 00:08:22,750
We don't have any friendship to reminisce anymore.

67
00:08:23,860 --> 00:08:25,530
Xiao Huan.

68
00:08:25,530 --> 00:08:28,590
-Let's go.<br>-Wait! Leave with you?

69
00:08:28,590 --> 00:08:30,390
What if you lose Xiao Huan?

70
00:08:30,390 --> 00:08:32,260
Our matters have nothing to do with you!

71
00:08:32,260 --> 00:08:36,060
Xiao Huan's matters have to do with me!

72
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:39,440
You Qing Yun disciples!

73
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:43,730
You keep calling yourselves heroes, but when you run into danger,

74
00:08:43,730 --> 00:08:46,980
you only care about your own safety and push others to shield you.

75
00:08:46,980 --> 00:08:49,810
In the past it was Guili, and now it's Xiao Huan.

76
00:08:49,810 --> 00:08:52,130
What are you guys doing?

77
00:08:52,130 --> 00:08:53,970
Shu Shu!

78
00:08:54,010 --> 00:08:59,190
Brother Guili saved me earlier. He and Wild Dog are good people.

79
00:09:00,230 --> 00:09:04,530
I helped you so much. You can't scold me like that.

80
00:09:04,550 --> 00:09:07,960
Who is a good person? I'm a bad person!

81
00:09:07,960 --> 00:09:09,710
Okay okay.

82
00:09:09,740 --> 00:09:13,330
You're a bad person. A awful person that treats me well, okay?

83
00:09:13,330 --> 00:09:16,680
I looked for you all day, but I actually interrupted you guys?

84
00:09:16,680 --> 00:09:18,640
I interrupted your little reunion between friends, right?

85
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:22,350
Since it's like that, then just stay with them.

86
00:09:26,450 --> 00:09:27,980
He also is just confused because of too much worrying.

87
00:09:27,980 --> 00:09:31,550
Don't be angry at him. Go on.

88
00:09:31,550 --> 00:09:34,120
This...

89
00:09:34,140 --> 00:09:38,610
Then Sister, you two must be careful.

90
00:09:38,610 --> 00:09:41,120
I'm off.

91
00:09:42,550 --> 00:09:44,500
Shu Shu!

92
00:09:52,220 --> 00:09:54,060
Shu Shu!

93
00:09:58,600 --> 00:10:00,680
Shu Shu!

94
00:10:08,730 --> 00:10:11,240
Should we go after Guili now?

95
00:10:11,240 --> 00:10:13,460
You go. I have to follow the people from the Ten Thousand Poison Sect.

96
00:10:13,460 --> 00:10:15,260
To look for Qin Wu Yan?

97
00:10:15,260 --> 00:10:17,280
Guili will deal with Qin Wu Yan.

98
00:10:17,280 --> 00:10:21,460
I'm going to look for Bai Du Zi. I must not let him leave here alive.

99
00:10:21,460 --> 00:10:24,120
Or else, my sect and my sisters in the embroidery shop

100
00:10:24,120 --> 00:10:26,490
will never live in peace.

101
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:48,730
<i>Everyone, let's separate and look around. After 4 hours, let's meet back here.</i>

102
00:10:50,660 --> 00:10:54,220
Is there meat eating monsters in the lake?

103
00:10:54,250 --> 00:10:56,870
The water is clear enough to see the bottom.

104
00:10:56,900 --> 00:11:01,120
But the grasses and vines beneath the water has all withered and died.

105
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:04,880
I believe it was poisoned.

106
00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:08,290
Poisoned? Could it be the Ten Thousand Poison Sect?

107
00:11:10,140 --> 00:11:11,780
Xue Qi!

108
00:11:12,870 --> 00:11:14,570
Xue Qi!

109
00:11:14,570 --> 00:11:16,960
You're finally back! Are you okay?

110
00:11:16,960 --> 00:11:18,430
I'm okay, thanks.

111
00:11:18,430 --> 00:11:22,080
Our little sister Xiao Huan is very lucky. She has protection no matter where she goes.

112
00:11:22,080 --> 00:11:23,590
What problems could there be?

113
00:11:23,590 --> 00:11:26,590
Xiao Huan, you ran into someone you knew?

114
00:11:27,510 --> 00:11:30,430
Sister Ping Er came too. She saved me.

115
00:11:36,410 --> 00:11:39,630
-The water is so clear!<br>-Don't touch it. The water is poisoned.

116
00:11:52,350 --> 00:11:57,760
Haven't you Fen Xiang Valley people always been very arrogant?

117
00:11:57,760 --> 00:12:01,180
Now you've fallen to such a state. How funny.

118
00:12:01,180 --> 00:12:04,540
You demon! Kill me now if you can!

119
00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:08,380
Or else in the future, I'll shred you to pieces!

120
00:12:14,500 --> 00:12:18,950
You're still so brave in the face of death. How fortunate.

121
00:12:18,950 --> 00:12:24,160
I can spare you. But, he must die.

122
00:12:27,390 --> 00:12:31,250
Mr. Poison, based upon our previous alliance,

123
00:12:31,250 --> 00:12:34,390
what good is there to kill me?

124
00:12:34,390 --> 00:12:39,450
Yes. What good is it to me to kill you?

125
00:12:39,450 --> 00:12:42,350
It's not useful to me.

126
00:12:42,380 --> 00:12:45,920
I just feel...happy.

127
00:12:58,250 --> 00:13:03,020
Qin Wu Yan! You demon! You won't die well!

128
00:13:16,200 --> 00:13:19,710
Junior Sister! Hurry! Kill him!

129
00:13:21,610 --> 00:13:22,800
Hurry and hand over the antidote!

130
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:24,770
You've already been hit with my poison.

131
00:13:24,770 --> 00:13:28,720
Without an antidote, your whole body will soon decay and die.

132
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:32,660
You-! Senior Brother, what should we do?

133
00:13:34,900 --> 00:13:38,420
Even if you kill me, I want you to taste

134
00:13:38,450 --> 00:13:41,730
I am currently experiencing being devoured by thousands of poisonous bugs.

135
00:15:51,700 --> 00:15:54,830
Why? Why are you protecting him?!

136
00:15:58,670 --> 00:16:03,780
I'll give you two choices. One, kill Qin Wu Yan and get revenge for the Old City Chief.

137
00:16:03,780 --> 00:16:06,020
I won't interfere.

138
00:16:06,020 --> 00:16:10,410
But their poison won't be oxidized. Their bodies will decay and then they'll die.

139
00:16:10,410 --> 00:16:14,920
Two, let Qin Wu Yan go in exchange for the antidote.

140
00:16:24,380 --> 00:16:26,980
-We want the antidote.<br>-Shut up!

141
00:16:47,060 --> 00:16:49,170
Have him hand over the antidote.

142
00:17:31,060 --> 00:17:36,900
Later, I will go ahead first to enter the interior of the marsh. You stay behind to closely monitor Qin Wu Yan.

143
00:17:36,900 --> 00:17:39,860
After the poison in his body kicks in,

144
00:17:39,860 --> 00:17:44,260
send him and those righteous disciples on their way.

145
00:17:44,260 --> 00:17:48,270
Teacher. You don't intend to continue controlling him

146
00:17:48,270 --> 00:17:49,850
and make him work for you?

147
00:17:49,850 --> 00:17:53,030
I discovered long ago that he intended to betray me.

148
00:17:53,030 --> 00:17:58,440
I had to get rid of him eventually. Why not let him die cleanly there?

149
00:17:58,440 --> 00:18:00,010
That will destroy any future troubles.

150
00:18:00,010 --> 00:18:01,520
Yes.

151
00:18:09,250 --> 00:18:13,910
You are just trying to guard against me. Afraid that I will steal the strange treasure from you.

152
00:18:27,820 --> 00:18:29,210
Jing Ping Er! What are you doing?

153
00:18:29,210 --> 00:18:31,130
Killing you!

154
00:18:45,360 --> 00:18:49,360
-Where is Zhang Xiao Fan?<br>-Ask her! They're on the same side!

155
00:18:51,720 --> 00:18:54,010
Where is Xiao Fan? Tell him to come out!

156
00:18:54,010 --> 00:18:55,720
I received a letter from the Ghost King before I came.

157
00:18:55,730 --> 00:18:59,470
He asked me to use this opportunity to eliminate Long Life Sect and Thousand Poison Sect.

158
00:18:59,470 --> 00:19:02,610
As for Guili, he works alone. I don't know anything.

159
00:19:02,610 --> 00:19:04,900
You ruined my plan this time.

160
00:19:04,930 --> 00:19:08,440
I'll forget it this time because you saved my life before. But next time,

161
00:19:08,440 --> 00:19:10,820
it won't be this simple!

162
00:19:33,100 --> 00:19:35,430
Why did you save me?

163
00:19:35,430 --> 00:19:41,090
You said before that you want to watch how I fall into killing and hatred.

164
00:19:41,090 --> 00:19:44,820
You want to see my final ending with Bi Yao.

165
00:19:44,820 --> 00:19:49,220
The ending hasn't arrived yet. So you cannot die.

166
00:19:53,310 --> 00:19:57,970
Now, I am still searching for a way to resurrect Bi Yao.

167
00:19:57,970 --> 00:20:02,190
Then you should kill me. Even if you don't,

168
00:20:03,130 --> 00:20:05,590
Poison God will send me to kill you.

169
00:20:06,990 --> 00:20:11,070
That's fine. You should know very well in your heart.

170
00:20:11,070 --> 00:20:15,960
Even if you return to the Ten Thousand Poison Sect, Poison God won't spare you.

171
00:20:18,690 --> 00:20:22,250
You're not afraid I'll stop you from getting the magic water?

172
00:20:22,250 --> 00:20:24,410
You wouldn't.

173
00:20:24,410 --> 00:20:27,880
You almost ripped Yu Yang Zi to shreds before.

174
00:20:29,270 --> 00:20:31,160
That was for Bi Yao, right?

175
00:20:48,560 --> 00:20:51,730
Didn't I tell you to watch Qin Wu Yan? Why did you catch up so soon?

176
00:20:51,730 --> 00:20:54,330
Qin Wu Yan has joined forces with Jing Ping Er and Guili.

177
00:20:54,330 --> 00:20:57,200
He injured me and spared the Qing Yun Sect members.

178
00:20:57,200 --> 00:20:59,670
They're coming this way.

179
00:21:02,080 --> 00:21:05,520
I knew that traitor would betray me.

180
00:21:07,040 --> 00:21:10,580
But that's okay. I've already activated the poison in his body.

181
00:21:10,580 --> 00:21:13,380
Within twelve hours, he will definitely die.

182
00:21:13,380 --> 00:21:15,940
Then, what should we do now?

183
00:21:18,560 --> 00:21:22,320
Tonight, have the remaining disciples get ready

184
00:21:22,320 --> 00:21:24,530
to attack them!

185
00:21:25,960 --> 00:21:27,760
Yes.

186
00:21:36,130 --> 00:21:37,790
Do you have any medicinal pill for healing injuries?

187
00:21:37,790 --> 00:21:42,420
I'm sorry. Our Tian Ying Peak cultivates inner power. We don't create pills.

188
00:21:47,270 --> 00:21:51,070
Doesn't Qing Yun have a lot of magical plants and medicine? Did you bring any with you?

189
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:55,700
What is it? You can't bear to let us use it?

190
00:21:55,700 --> 00:21:58,410
Of course not. We fought with the Long Life Sect before,

191
00:21:58,410 --> 00:22:02,090
and a lot of junior brothers were hurt. We're almost out of medicine.

192
00:22:06,760 --> 00:22:10,290
You drove the bugs away before, and this time we saved you.

193
00:22:10,290 --> 00:22:13,030
Let's call it even. Stop asking for more.

194
00:22:13,030 --> 00:22:15,350
You watched Qin Wu Yan leave.

195
00:22:15,370 --> 00:22:17,080
Can you answer to Grandpa like that?

196
00:22:17,080 --> 00:22:19,120
Qin Wu Yan is the one who killed Grandpa.

197
00:22:19,120 --> 00:22:23,430
If I got caught by him, I surely won't beg him to spare my life.

198
00:22:23,430 --> 00:22:26,680
I didn't beg him to spare me!

199
00:22:26,680 --> 00:22:31,940
I just helped buy some time for you guys and for him to lower down his guard.

200
00:22:31,940 --> 00:22:33,690
Who's there?

201
00:22:38,920 --> 00:22:41,510
Jing Yu. Why did you take so long?

202
00:22:41,510 --> 00:22:44,540
Senior Brother, I was investigating in the forest,

203
00:22:44,540 --> 00:22:46,780
and discovered the demon sects destroying each other.

204
00:22:46,780 --> 00:22:51,280
Jing Yu. Did you see anyone familiar?

205
00:22:52,760 --> 00:22:55,160
I only saw people from the Ten Thousand Poison Sect.

206
00:22:55,160 --> 00:23:01,320
Jing Ping Er and Bai Du Zi were there too. What about you all? Did you see other demon sect members?

207
00:23:06,460 --> 00:23:09,530
Rest well. Let's just recuperate and build up our energy.

208
00:23:54,700 --> 00:23:57,870
Bi Yao, I spared Qin Wu Yan today.

209
00:23:59,060 --> 00:24:01,100
I don't know why either.

210
00:24:02,290 --> 00:24:07,630
In this world, besides your father, he's the only one who makes me think of you.

211
00:24:15,150 --> 00:24:19,570
Actually, I could tell ten years ago. He cares a lot about you.

212
00:24:21,320 --> 00:24:26,060
You always say I'm silly. But I'm not stupid.

213
00:24:27,260 --> 00:24:31,490
You're so good. Lots of people probably like you.

214
00:24:31,490 --> 00:24:33,650
But you like me.

215
00:24:39,220 --> 00:24:41,000
Bi Yao.

216
00:24:42,060 --> 00:24:48,330
As long as I get into the Emperor of Heaven's Treasure Trove, I can find the magical water that can revive you.

217
00:24:49,470 --> 00:24:52,060
then you can return to my side.

218
00:26:06,830 --> 00:26:08,720
Enemy!

219
00:26:21,470 --> 00:26:23,250
Hurry!

220
00:26:51,940 --> 00:26:54,600
Everyone be careful! There's poison on their bodies!

221
00:27:00,100 --> 00:27:03,040
Shu Shu! Hurry and take Yan Hong and Xiao Huan away!

222
00:27:05,030 --> 00:27:07,000
Let's go!

223
00:27:11,990 --> 00:27:14,900
-You two stay here. You must not run around.<br>-Okay.

224
00:27:22,540 --> 00:27:25,690
<i>They are demonic humans created by the Ten Thousand Poison Sect. They are very dangerous.</i>

225
00:27:25,690 --> 00:27:27,830
<i>You must not get near them.</i>

226
00:27:33,760 --> 00:27:37,580
<i>First use fire to burn them, then destroy them with cold ice!</i>

227
00:27:49,250 --> 00:27:52,120
Use fire to burn them, then ice!

228
00:28:36,400 --> 00:28:38,760
What are those things?

229
00:28:38,760 --> 00:28:42,650
They should be disciples Poison God modified.

230
00:28:42,650 --> 00:28:46,350
Ten years ago, I once came across them in Kong San Mountain.

231
00:28:46,350 --> 00:28:48,590
Their bodies are very strong, completely impenetrable.

232
00:28:49,690 --> 00:28:53,700
But Shu Shu, you didn't go to Kong San Mountain with us last time.

233
00:28:53,700 --> 00:28:55,930
How did you know how to deal with them?

234
00:29:00,760 --> 00:29:03,710
Ssenior Brothers, are you okay?

235
00:29:03,710 --> 00:29:06,500
-I should be able to hang in there.<br>-How are you feeling?

236
00:29:06,500 --> 00:29:10,310
I want to rest. I should be fine.

237
00:29:23,140 --> 00:29:27,620
<i>How did you think of this method to destroy the modified Ten Thousand Poison Sect disciples?</i>

238
00:29:29,220 --> 00:29:31,670
After I faced danger in Kong San Mountain in the past,

239
00:29:31,670 --> 00:29:34,260
I always thought about what method to use

240
00:29:34,260 --> 00:29:38,350
to fight the Ten Thousand Poison Sect without making you worry about me.

241
00:29:38,350 --> 00:29:41,780
Later on when I wandered the world, I happened to see it.

242
00:29:41,780 --> 00:29:44,410
The weapons inside the metal neighborhood are tempered.

243
00:29:44,410 --> 00:29:46,870
Then I thought of that idea.

244
00:30:04,950 --> 00:30:06,840
Deputy Sect Leader!

245
00:30:17,170 --> 00:30:19,150
Deputy Sect Leader!

246
00:30:20,760 --> 00:30:22,520
Guili!

247
00:30:32,560 --> 00:30:34,260
Are you tired?

248
00:30:34,260 --> 00:30:37,880
You're dreaming in the middle of the day. Are you seeing hallucinations?

249
00:30:39,240 --> 00:30:42,710
H-how about we find a place to rest?

250
00:30:46,470 --> 00:30:51,520
If it really was a dream, staying in my dreams all the time,

251
00:30:51,520 --> 00:30:53,560
would be quite nice.

252
00:30:54,670 --> 00:30:58,820
Our temporary lives are just like dreams. How many times have we been happy?

253
00:31:07,740 --> 00:31:10,360
A poet!

254
00:31:14,880 --> 00:31:17,340
I made such an effort,

255
00:31:17,340 --> 00:31:19,810
but it was all in vain!

256
00:31:30,830 --> 00:31:34,070
What are you hiding for?!

257
00:31:35,060 --> 00:31:39,170
I'm telling you! If you still can't get rid of the Qing Yun Sect people, then you'll all die!

258
00:31:39,170 --> 00:31:42,710
Senior Brother, I'm begging you. Don't turn us into poison people.

259
00:31:42,710 --> 00:31:46,420
We can...can...secretly ambush them!

260
00:31:46,420 --> 00:31:48,490
We can only do that now.

261
00:31:49,540 --> 00:31:53,280
Follow them closely! Kill them all!

262
00:32:03,480 --> 00:32:05,830
Did you come after me to get revenge?

263
00:32:26,570 --> 00:32:31,610
Your clothes are quite pretty. The Ghost King Sect's deputy sect leader has quite the aura.

264
00:32:34,500 --> 00:32:36,700
Just say what you want.

265
00:32:38,620 --> 00:32:41,550
Be a good person until the end, I want to ask you for one more favor.

266
00:32:41,550 --> 00:32:47,120
Righteous and demonic cannot stand on the same side. Deal with your own matters yourself.

267
00:32:47,120 --> 00:32:49,360
Senior Brother Da Ren is hurt.

268
00:32:50,630 --> 00:32:52,620
He needs an antidote.

269
00:32:57,200 --> 00:33:00,640
Deputy Sect Leader. Don't help them!

270
00:33:52,530 --> 00:33:55,740
Come back! Come back, all of you!

271
00:33:55,740 --> 00:34:02,430
Bai Du Zi. I didn't think that a watchdog like you would fall to this state.

272
00:34:02,430 --> 00:34:06,320
Behave more judiciously. Hurry and hand over the antidote for the poisons from your demonic humans.

273
00:34:06,320 --> 00:34:11,040
Wild Dog! You joined hands with the Qing Yun Sect?

274
00:34:13,320 --> 00:34:17,650
If you drag out time even more, then it'll hurt even more!

275
00:34:29,980 --> 00:34:34,330
Okay! I'll give it to you!

276
00:35:52,670 --> 00:35:54,480
<i>This is the legendary strange treasure?</i>

277
00:35:54,480 --> 00:35:56,250
It should be.

278
00:35:57,510 --> 00:35:59,460
He is also looking for it.

279
00:36:00,600 --> 00:36:02,610
No matter if it is or not,

280
00:36:02,610 --> 00:36:06,280
The gold light is so clear. We have to hurry and tell Senior Brother Xiao.

281
00:36:06,280 --> 00:36:10,180
Since you came, you still want to leave?

282
00:36:17,120 --> 00:36:19,220
Poison God?

283
00:36:19,230 --> 00:36:22,290
From the two battles at Kongsan Mountain and at Qing Yun,

284
00:36:22,290 --> 00:36:27,350
you have killed so many of my men. Today, I want you all to pay with your life!

285
00:36:55,890 --> 00:36:58,830
-It's Guili!<br>-Let's go!

286
00:37:01,250 --> 00:37:05,830
Who? Just who is it? Come out!

287
00:37:10,180 --> 00:37:13,640
Teacher, should we go after them?

288
00:37:13,640 --> 00:37:17,810
- No need. Finding the Emperor of Heaven's Treasure Trove is more important.<br>- Yes.

289
00:37:33,890 --> 00:37:36,140
Senior Brother Da Ren, how do you feel?

290
00:37:36,140 --> 00:37:37,750
A lot better.

291
00:37:40,770 --> 00:37:44,940
That's right, Shu Shu. Who gave you the antidote?

292
00:37:50,010 --> 00:37:54,170
Xue Qi, Jing Yu. You're finally back.

293
00:37:55,230 --> 00:37:57,410
How is it? Are you alright?

294
00:37:59,970 --> 00:38:02,150
You don't need to keep secrets anymore.

295
00:38:03,160 --> 00:38:07,030
He gave you the antidote, right?

296
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:12,290
Senior Brother, Xiao Fan definitely doesn't intend to harm us.

297
00:38:12,290 --> 00:38:15,090
Or else, he wouldn't help us get the antidote.

298
00:38:15,090 --> 00:38:20,970
Senior Brother Xiao. I once saw that gold light in the forest.

299
00:38:22,850 --> 00:38:24,380
But the strange treasure...

300
00:38:24,380 --> 00:38:27,680
Golden light erupting. Shooting up into the clouds.

301
00:38:27,690 --> 00:38:30,260
It's the same as the legends say.

302
00:38:30,260 --> 00:38:33,020
But there are Ten Thousand Poison Sect ambushes nearby.

303
00:38:33,020 --> 00:38:37,580
If Xiao Fan didn't help us, it would have been hard for us to escape.

304
00:38:39,370 --> 00:38:43,850
You chased after him, but fell into a trap?

305
00:38:43,850 --> 00:38:46,190
That's too big of a coincidence.

306
00:38:47,390 --> 00:38:49,420
Or perhaps he wants to give us the antidote, so

307
00:38:49,420 --> 00:38:52,480
he can borrow our hand to get rid of Poison God!

308
00:38:52,480 --> 00:38:55,130
Senior Brother. You're overthinking it.

309
00:38:55,130 --> 00:38:58,090
You're oversimplifying it.

310
00:38:58,090 --> 00:39:02,160
If he really values old relationships, why didn't he come to make that clear face to face?

311
00:39:02,160 --> 00:39:05,050
Perhaps, he has his reasons and cannot reveal himself?

312
00:39:05,050 --> 00:39:09,220
That's right. You keep saying that the righteous and evil sects cannot coexist together.

313
00:39:09,220 --> 00:39:12,080
-It'd be weird of Brother Guili would show himself.<br>-Xiao Huan!

314
00:39:12,080 --> 00:39:14,790
Senior Brother, he was the one that reminded us a few days ago

315
00:39:14,790 --> 00:39:18,660
to keep an eye on the Ten Thousand Poison Sect's attacks. If he intended to harm us,

316
00:39:18,660 --> 00:39:21,350
why would he repeatedly secretly help us?

317
00:39:23,920 --> 00:39:28,520
Senior Brother. I know Xiao Fan well. His heart is soft, and he is loyal.

318
00:39:28,550 --> 00:39:31,790
He came back to Da Zhu Palace to see Teacher not long ago.

319
00:39:31,790 --> 00:39:35,570
If we are to say he doesn't value old relationships, I won't believe it.

320
00:39:37,870 --> 00:39:43,140
Okay. Then you're all sure he's friend and not foe, right?

321
00:39:43,140 --> 00:39:45,470
What do you intend to do next?

322
00:39:50,320 --> 00:39:52,590
Junior brothers,

323
00:39:52,590 --> 00:39:54,590
stop being so stubborn.

324
00:39:54,590 --> 00:39:57,530
When the Chusen Sword came down ten years ago at Clear Jade Palace,

325
00:39:57,530 --> 00:40:00,520
he already wasn't the old Zhang Xiao Fan then!
