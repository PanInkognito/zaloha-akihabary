00:00:04,620 --> 00:00:06,000
Eh?

3
00:00:06,300 --> 00:00:09,270
A dog can born up to 19 pups

4
00:00:09,940 --> 00:00:11,110
19?

5
00:00:11,110 --> 00:00:12,510
Trying to create a fortress?

6
00:00:12,870 --> 00:00:16,080
The need to have some fierce sexual intercourse, right?

7
00:00:16,180 --> 00:00:17,080
Ah...

8
00:00:17,230 --> 00:00:18,600
I want to have sex

9
00:00:19,410 --> 00:00:21,050
and feel that passionate sexual feeling

10
00:00:21,550 --> 00:00:22,920
Pervert

11
00:00:23,030 --> 00:00:23,830
Huh?

12
00:00:23,950 --> 00:00:26,090
Don't start imaging sex just by looking at the dog article

13
00:00:26,090 --> 00:00:27,260
I wasn't

14
00:00:27,640 --> 00:00:29,260
I wasn't doing such thing

15
00:00:29,260 --> 00:00:31,460
When you think about it, people do not welcome these kind of stuff

16
00:00:31,460 --> 00:00:32,590
Obviously

17
00:00:32,860 --> 00:00:35,800
How come these two know exactly what I am thinking?

18
00:00:38,200 --> 00:00:39,570
Huh?

19
00:00:40,070 --> 00:00:40,640
Oh no!

20
00:00:41,420 --> 00:00:43,420
kid bury the glory and the name

21
00:00:44,310 --> 00:00:44,980
Didn't

22
00:00:45,390 --> 00:00:47,390
someone brought this dog to here before?

23
00:00:47,580 --> 00:00:48,640
Here?

24
00:00:49,480 --> 00:00:51,650
I have no memory of it

25
00:00:53,110 --> 00:00:54,780
How about ordering juice?

26
00:00:55,320 --> 00:00:56,720
Welcome

27
00:01:01,090 --> 00:01:04,190
Sae, we have to stay alert since there is always something happening here

28
00:01:04,190 --> 00:01:06,730
You're right but it doesn't bother me

29
00:01:06,730 --> 00:01:07,860
You're right

30
00:01:09,160 --> 00:01:10,970
What's wrong with Asami-san?

31
00:01:11,370 --> 00:01:13,970
I fought with someone and we didn't talk for a week

32
00:01:13,970 --> 00:01:14,600
You're right

33
00:01:15,350 --> 00:01:17,350
saying stuff like "you never understand me"

34
00:01:17,970 --> 00:01:19,040
You're right

35
00:01:19,970 --> 00:01:22,340
Probably fought with a man right?

36
00:01:22,710 --> 00:01:24,210
Man?

37
00:01:26,910 --> 00:01:28,920
Fathers are really annoying

38
00:01:28,920 --> 00:01:30,900
Fathers are indeed annoying

39
00:01:31,150 --> 00:01:31,620
Fa...

40
00:01:32,370 --> 00:01:33,960
Father?

41
00:01:33,960 --> 00:01:36,990
So the reason why Asami-san is like this is because she fought with her father

42
00:01:37,730 --> 00:01:38,600
Hey

43
00:01:39,270 --> 00:01:42,040
how can you talk about your father like that

44
00:01:42,230 --> 00:01:43,130
But he's annoying

45
00:01:43,230 --> 00:01:44,210
Exactly

46
00:01:44,500 --> 00:01:46,100
You have to be grateful

47
00:01:46,100 --> 00:01:48,370
so you can't talk like that about your father

48
00:01:48,770 --> 00:01:51,740
Originally you girls came from your father's sperm

49
00:01:52,210 --> 00:01:54,180
That's disgusting

50
00:01:54,280 --> 00:01:55,780
What the....stop talking about it!

51
00:01:55,780 --> 00:01:56,590
Yea

52
00:01:57,550 --> 00:01:58,710
Asami-san

53
00:03:19,530 --> 00:03:21,930
They are finally moving

54
00:03:22,660 --> 00:03:23,860
We have no time

55
00:03:24,270 --> 00:03:25,530
Yes

56
00:03:25,830 --> 00:03:29,070
Making weak-minded people to master their psychic ability is an extremely dangerous task

57
00:03:31,070 --> 00:03:32,680
If he or she has a rotten desire

58
00:03:32,950 --> 00:03:34,400
then there will be no way to continue

59
00:03:38,210 --> 00:03:41,020
First we must put the psychics on the right path

60
00:03:42,280 --> 00:03:44,750
With this we already have the ability to get close to them

61
00:03:45,190 --> 00:03:46,890
We must hurry up and gather them together

62
00:03:46,890 --> 00:03:48,090
Yes

63
00:03:49,420 --> 00:03:50,600
Akiyama-kun

64
00:03:50,740 --> 00:03:52,240
the fate of the world

65
00:03:52,860 --> 00:03:54,500
rest on our hands

66
00:04:03,500 --> 00:04:04,600
I am saying the truth

67
00:04:04,600 --> 00:04:07,600
erotic stuff is a really deep matter

68
00:04:08,580 --> 00:04:09,010
Huh?

69
00:04:09,890 --> 00:04:11,010
What is it?

70
00:04:11,410 --> 00:04:12,190
Isn't

71
00:04:13,020 --> 00:04:14,600
that Natsume sensei and Hayashi sensei?

72
00:04:15,320 --> 00:04:17,690
They are probably having an affair, right?

73
00:04:18,350 --> 00:04:21,460
Both Natsume sensei and Hayashi sensei are not married, right?

74
00:04:22,360 --> 00:04:23,730
Being a teacher and allow to do this

75
00:04:24,230 --> 00:04:26,030
is really erotic!

76
00:04:26,030 --> 00:04:27,760
I just said they are both not marry

77
00:04:28,330 --> 00:04:30,060
The sexual intercourse must be good, right?

78
00:04:30,060 --> 00:04:31,800
Don't be like this Yasu!

79
00:04:32,430 --> 00:04:33,600
Don't be like this!

80
00:04:33,980 --> 00:04:35,280
Yasu

81
00:04:36,500 --> 00:04:38,010
So it's our students

82
00:04:38,010 --> 00:04:39,980
Shit fucking asshole

83
00:04:40,010 --> 00:04:40,510
Don't be like this!

84
00:04:40,510 --> 00:04:42,390
The teachers are having an affair!

85
00:04:42,399 --> 00:04:44,399
Yasu, don't be like this!

86
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:45,980
Don't be like this, Yasu!

87
00:04:45,980 --> 00:04:47,080
Fuck

88
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:49,650
Penis!

89
00:04:50,650 --> 00:04:51,820
What's wrong, Yasu?

90
00:04:51,820 --> 00:04:54,960
It hurts!

91
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:56,060
What's wrong?

92
00:04:56,060 --> 00:04:56,600
Penis!

93
00:04:56,600 --> 00:04:57,230
Penis?

94
00:04:57,230 --> 00:04:57,800
Penis!

95
00:04:57,800 --> 00:04:58,770
What about it?

96
00:04:58,770 --> 00:04:59,600
Someone is holding on to it

97
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:00,570
Holding on?

98
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:03,800
Natsume-kun

99
00:05:04,440 --> 00:05:07,390
look here my own penis isn't feeling comfortable either

100
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:12,010
This is the best way to punish fucking assholes

101
00:05:17,040 --> 00:05:18,150
Fuck!

102
00:05:19,750 --> 00:05:24,400
Fuck!

103
00:05:24,570 --> 00:05:25,230
Could it be

104
00:05:25,230 --> 00:05:26,560
Natsume sensei...

105
00:05:34,730 --> 00:05:35,600
Hayashi sensei?

106
00:05:36,870 --> 00:05:37,800
both of them...

107
00:05:58,020 --> 00:05:59,850
Politics right now

108
00:06:07,960 --> 00:06:08,830
That's not right

109
00:06:09,100 --> 00:06:12,580
Japan's economic problem is actually very deep-rotted

110
00:06:19,670 --> 00:06:20,840
Nagano-san

111
00:06:20,840 --> 00:06:21,680
Eh?

112
00:06:22,710 --> 00:06:24,180
Do you want to order again?

113
00:06:24,550 --> 00:06:25,910
How do you know my name?

114
00:06:27,210 --> 00:06:28,150
You're

115
00:06:28,820 --> 00:06:29,820
a psychic, right?

116
00:06:30,790 --> 00:06:31,200
Eh?

117
00:06:31,790 --> 00:06:32,400
That...

118
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:35,560
es...

119
00:06:35,860 --> 00:06:36,860
espresso

120
00:06:37,160 --> 00:06:38,460
you want espresso?

121
00:06:38,690 --> 00:06:40,360
Okay, I got it

122
00:06:55,600 --> 00:06:56,690
so dangerous

123
00:06:56,690 --> 00:06:57,650
finally lost her

124
00:06:58,220 --> 00:06:59,820
This is my first time seeing such big breast

125
00:06:59,820 --> 00:07:01,780
I can't take it any longer

126
00:07:02,820 --> 00:07:05,220
This is the best plan so there shouldn't be a problem

127
00:07:08,220 --> 00:07:09,260
Crap!

128
00:07:14,700 --> 00:07:16,000
How is this possible?

129
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,600
I thought I clearly lost her

130
00:07:34,680 --> 00:07:36,650
What is this, still chasing after me?

131
00:07:38,220 --> 00:07:39,400
Wait!

132
00:07:39,400 --> 00:07:40,180
This is not okay

133
00:07:40,180 --> 00:07:41,420
Go back with me

134
00:07:41,700 --> 00:07:42,600
Wait!

135
00:07:48,030 --> 00:07:50,430
So interesting!

136
00:07:50,430 --> 00:07:52,100
This is so good!

137
00:07:53,470 --> 00:07:54,100
Nice

138
00:07:54,200 --> 00:07:56,040
If it is like this then there will be no problem running away

139
00:07:59,110 --> 00:07:59,710
What is this?

140
00:07:59,710 --> 00:08:00,200
Stop!

141
00:08:03,080 --> 00:08:04,480
This is...

142
00:08:07,450 --> 00:08:08,680
capoeira

143
00:08:20,900 --> 00:08:22,100
Oh!

144
00:08:22,730 --> 00:08:24,330
so it's like this

145
00:08:24,830 --> 00:08:27,220
If you're going to use force then I won't go easy on you

146
00:08:31,340 --> 00:08:33,910
It never occur to me that I have to use this tactic this fast

147
00:08:34,940 --> 00:08:37,910
Upcoming is a special segment of Jackie Chen

148
00:08:38,250 --> 00:08:39,850
Jackie Chen is the strongest

149
00:08:42,720 --> 00:08:45,350
Telekinesis strongest point is striking at stuff

150
00:08:46,090 --> 00:08:48,460
The most handsome man

151
00:08:49,160 --> 00:08:49,860
This is

152
00:08:50,190 --> 00:08:52,530
end of the world winds fist

153
00:09:06,110 --> 00:09:07,140
Huh?

154
00:09:07,810 --> 00:09:08,900
Crap!

155
00:09:09,140 --> 00:09:11,550
How come it only moves her breasts?

156
00:09:12,910 --> 00:09:14,150
But it's so good to look at

157
00:09:14,350 --> 00:09:14,720
Forget it

158
00:09:21,560 --> 00:09:23,490
Oh!

159
00:09:23,690 --> 00:09:25,490
So black

160
00:09:39,070 --> 00:09:40,380
So there was no need for physical strength

161
00:09:43,240 --> 00:09:43,900
Right

162
00:09:43,900 --> 00:09:46,280
This is the perfect time to make my escape

163
00:09:51,050 --> 00:09:53,090
If you can run up to here alive I consider you the winner

164
00:10:03,930 --> 00:10:05,570
How can it be so noisy?

165
00:10:06,740 --> 00:10:09,440
My head is nothing but his matters

166
00:10:10,010 --> 00:10:12,240
How come it is only fill of Yoshiro?

167
00:10:14,440 --> 00:10:15,900
Did I became crazy?

168
00:10:17,350 --> 00:10:18,780
After all, a psychic...

169
00:10:20,980 --> 00:10:22,120
Miyuki-chan

170
00:10:23,320 --> 00:10:23,960
What?

171
00:10:24,380 --> 00:10:26,350
You need to learn how to walk

172
00:10:26,350 --> 00:10:27,350
It's dangerous

173
00:10:28,020 --> 00:10:29,120
Sorry

174
00:10:30,630 --> 00:10:32,430
What was Miyuki-chan doing at first?

175
00:10:32,890 --> 00:10:35,430
How come you were saying my name in your head?

176
00:10:35,430 --> 00:10:35,830
Eh?

177
00:10:36,230 --> 00:10:37,770
Yoshiro and so on

178
00:10:38,900 --> 00:10:39,600
Ah!

179
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,000
So it wasn't unintentionally

180
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:43,410
but a confession

181
00:10:43,410 --> 00:10:44,410
What did you say?

182
00:10:44,840 --> 00:10:46,410
I never said anything like that

183
00:10:46,410 --> 00:10:47,440
-Then say what it is
-It's nothing!

184
00:10:54,150 --> 00:10:59,350
-Then say what it is
-It's nothing!

185
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:01,620
What's wrong Terumitsu-san?

186
00:11:01,620 --> 00:11:02,860
Where did you fall from?

187
00:11:04,790 --> 00:11:06,330
That hot sexual woman!

188
00:11:06,830 --> 00:11:07,900
Kamogawa Yoshiro!

189
00:11:07,900 --> 00:11:09,260
Hirano Miyuki!

190
00:11:09,830 --> 00:11:11,830
Please come with me!

191
00:11:13,770 --> 00:11:15,270
First please allow me to introduce myself

192
00:11:15,670 --> 00:11:17,180
I am from Tokyo University

193
00:11:17,300 --> 00:11:18,300
specialized in psychic affairs

194
00:11:18,570 --> 00:11:19,570
Asami Takahiro

195
00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:23,140
I may not understand how general people suddenly become psychics in the waking state

196
00:11:23,910 --> 00:11:24,910
but

197
00:11:24,910 --> 00:11:26,910
the psychic abilities that is coming from this small town

198
00:11:27,580 --> 00:11:29,490
we knew the answer from our research done years ago

199
00:11:29,490 --> 00:11:30,620
Therefore

200
00:11:30,980 --> 00:11:33,680
this is all the information we have on psychics

201
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:35,900
In 19th century

202
00:11:36,490 --> 00:11:39,400
in a small American town located in Minnesota called Dultch

203
00:11:39,900 --> 00:11:40,880
appeared

204
00:11:41,480 --> 00:11:43,660
a lot of psychics like you who transform during your sleep

205
00:11:44,100 --> 00:11:47,740
That is because once every 100 years the celestial bodies are align

206
00:11:47,740 --> 00:11:52,110
and then the bodies would emit rays. The rays emitted point straight at this small town for some time

207
00:11:52,470 --> 00:11:53,300
And now

208
00:11:54,440 --> 00:11:56,640
the alignment of the celestial bodies

209
00:11:56,640 --> 00:11:57,890
is happening again

210
00:11:58,410 --> 00:12:00,580
shooting its rays at Notsu in Oita Prefecture

211
00:12:00,580 --> 00:12:01,350
This happened

212
00:12:01,710 --> 00:12:02,900
during the previous eclipse

213
00:12:03,350 --> 00:12:04,400
So there's

214
00:12:04,400 --> 00:12:05,350
a reason!

215
00:12:06,060 --> 00:12:08,260
However, the rays that is pointing at this small town

216
00:12:08,260 --> 00:12:10,220
doesn't mean everyone can become a psychic

217
00:12:10,890 --> 00:12:13,630
This has to do with the exposure of your cells in your body

218
00:12:13,630 --> 00:12:14,930
There are 3 requirements

219
00:12:15,900 --> 00:12:16,630
Of course

220
00:12:16,960 --> 00:12:18,620
I am in the deity in this matter

221
00:12:18,970 --> 00:12:20,670
So people like us who have this special talent

222
00:12:21,100 --> 00:12:22,600
are psychics who experiences

223
00:12:22,860 --> 00:12:24,860
it during a waking state!

224
00:12:25,410 --> 00:12:26,840
3 requirements

225
00:12:30,970 --> 00:12:31,970
The first one is

226
00:12:32,920 --> 00:12:34,850
never had sexual experience before

227
00:12:36,610 --> 00:12:37,300
Eh?

228
00:12:38,190 --> 00:12:39,520
What kind of requirement is this?

229
00:12:39,760 --> 00:12:40,520
If its like this

230
00:12:40,520 --> 00:12:41,950
we are all virgins

231
00:12:47,930 --> 00:12:49,500
You're still a virgin

232
00:12:50,430 --> 00:12:51,340
Miykui-chan,

233
00:12:51,590 --> 00:12:52,590
that is shocking

234
00:12:53,470 --> 00:12:54,290
What's with your expression?

235
00:12:55,500 --> 00:12:57,300
What's so shocking about it?

236
00:13:08,920 --> 00:13:09,300
Ah

237
00:13:09,880 --> 00:13:12,880
so it's actually common for people to be like that

238
00:13:13,020 --> 00:13:16,390
However, thinking it again that means I am a virgin like you guys?

239
00:13:16,460 --> 00:13:20,060
No wonder my psychic ability trigger by erotic matters can only be awaken during a wakening state

240
00:13:20,100 --> 00:13:21,700
Oh, so it's like this

241
00:13:21,730 --> 00:13:22,300
Hm...

242
00:13:23,020 --> 00:13:25,020
but i don't like how its gregarious

243
00:13:25,040 --> 00:13:26,700
don't blame me for such thought

244
00:13:27,400 --> 00:13:30,070
Next is the second requirement

245
00:13:30,870 --> 00:13:32,570
the next part should be why we are choosen, right?

246
00:13:32,680 --> 00:13:33,580
Then

247
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,810
during he eclipse when the rays are pointing at this small town for a few minutes

248
00:13:36,810 --> 00:13:38,350
This must be how

249
00:13:38,440 --> 00:13:40,020
we are choose by celestial beings

250
00:13:40,020 --> 00:13:40,820
Your body

251
00:13:41,510 --> 00:13:43,610
must be able to reach a high climax state

252
00:13:44,340 --> 00:13:44,940
Huh?

253
00:13:45,790 --> 00:13:48,100
And when people achieve this high climax state

254
00:13:49,280 --> 00:13:50,680
it's calls masturbation!

255
00:13:50,990 --> 00:13:52,330
Correct

256
00:13:53,230 --> 00:13:54,300
Miyuki-chan

257
00:13:56,500 --> 00:13:58,300
So girls also masturbate, Hirano?

258
00:13:59,230 --> 00:14:00,970
Semen deposit confirm

259
00:14:01,640 --> 00:14:02,870
Miyuki-chan

260
00:14:03,130 --> 00:14:04,530
so it's like this

261
00:14:04,940 --> 00:14:06,740
Lastly, the third requirement

262
00:14:07,040 --> 00:14:09,350
You must have an extreme case of inferiority complex

263
00:14:09,680 --> 00:14:12,380
If you satisfied these three requirements you will become a psychic

264
00:14:12,580 --> 00:14:13,280
It's like this?

265
00:14:13,970 --> 00:14:14,970
That's it?

266
00:14:15,720 --> 00:14:17,750
This doesn't have anything to do with being chosen by the celestial beings!

267
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:20,190
It doesn't matter if you believe it, but I do

268
00:14:20,420 --> 00:14:24,660
However, from the celestial bodies to your power this is the conclusion of our research

269
00:14:25,030 --> 00:14:26,730
Morever, this is Akiyama-kun

270
00:14:27,100 --> 00:14:28,800
like you she fulfills these 3 requirements

271
00:14:29,320 --> 00:14:30,990
and also encountered the eclipse, thus making her a psychic too

272
00:14:31,270 --> 00:14:32,470
If you say it like this

273
00:14:32,940 --> 00:14:34,200
So you masturbate too?

274
00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:36,340
The psychic ability you have during the waking state

275
00:14:36,770 --> 00:14:39,440
is based on your level of consciousness

276
00:14:40,740 --> 00:14:43,210
She was scare of being used as an experiment

277
00:14:43,550 --> 00:14:45,110
like this she receives the power of precognition

278
00:14:45,550 --> 00:14:47,080
semen deposit is coming out

279
00:14:47,480 --> 00:14:48,620
Yes

280
00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:50,720
She always had an inferior complex with her breasts

281
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:52,390
So whenever someone is staring at her breasts

282
00:14:52,390 --> 00:14:53,840
she would be able to use this ability

283
00:14:54,820 --> 00:14:56,190
That's why during that time

284
00:14:56,790 --> 00:14:58,760
you let me see your breast

285
00:15:00,330 --> 00:15:03,630
At first you were talking about those psychics in America

286
00:15:03,630 --> 00:15:04,800
what happened to them?

287
00:15:07,540 --> 00:15:08,640
Truthfully

288
00:15:09,240 --> 00:15:11,270
this is the reason why we are gather you here

289
00:15:12,140 --> 00:15:15,980
This is an event that happened in 19th century Duluth

290
00:15:16,910 --> 00:15:17,620
The psychics

291
00:15:18,230 --> 00:15:19,230
they were all killed

292
00:15:20,120 --> 00:15:21,350
Killed?

293
00:15:21,350 --> 00:15:21,990
Why?

294
00:15:22,540 --> 00:15:23,300
Yes

295
00:15:24,620 --> 00:15:26,020
The entire group was killed

296
00:15:27,260 --> 00:15:28,360
Everyone with psychics power

297
00:15:29,790 --> 00:15:31,430
eventually killed each other

298
00:15:31,890 --> 00:15:33,260
Killed each other?

299
00:15:33,560 --> 00:15:34,530
Why?

300
00:15:34,930 --> 00:15:37,200
Why would they kill their own kind?

301
00:15:37,870 --> 00:15:38,470
It can't be

302
00:15:38,950 --> 00:15:40,340
right now

303
00:15:40,340 --> 00:15:41,870
the same thing will happen to this place

304
00:15:43,510 --> 00:15:44,510
This was a forum I discovered

305
00:15:45,010 --> 00:15:46,640
2 weeks ago on the Internet

306
00:15:46,880 --> 00:15:48,740
These are the messages left by a suspect

307
00:15:50,150 --> 00:15:51,650
What is this?

308
00:15:51,650 --> 00:15:53,080
You must be joking

309
00:15:53,080 --> 00:15:54,080
He's right

310
00:15:54,080 --> 00:15:55,360
Don't scare people

311
00:15:55,880 --> 00:15:57,320
This...

312
00:15:58,590 --> 00:16:00,290
We need to hurry up and find out

313
00:16:00,620 --> 00:16:02,260
the person who left such messages

314
00:16:02,990 --> 00:16:04,990
The time has finally come

315
00:16:06,230 --> 00:16:08,030
All psychics have a mutual attraction toward one another

316
00:16:08,830 --> 00:16:10,600
Therefore all of you have to be conscious of your surrounding

317
00:16:10,600 --> 00:16:12,270
and when you find something contact me immediately

318
00:16:13,200 --> 00:16:14,770
We cannot let Notsu in Oita Prefecture

319
00:16:14,770 --> 00:16:16,670
become the second Dultch city

320
00:16:17,870 --> 00:16:19,410
I will use my ability

321
00:16:20,610 --> 00:16:21,680
to save the world

322
00:16:22,910 --> 00:16:24,610
I hope everyone is able to lend me your ability

323
00:16:25,650 --> 00:16:26,680
We have to save Notsu, Oita Prefecture

324
00:16:26,680 --> 00:16:27,980
no we have to save the world

325
00:16:28,380 --> 00:16:30,650
or else it will fall in the hands of evil!

326
00:16:31,020 --> 00:16:33,120
The time to save the world has finally come

327
00:16:34,120 --> 00:16:35,720
Is this for real?

328
00:16:35,720 --> 00:16:37,360
It all sounds so silly

329
00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:39,400
Is what he saying even true?

330
00:16:39,400 --> 00:16:42,600
He's saying I am a virgin, that point proved that he is wrong already

331
00:16:42,830 --> 00:16:45,770
That theory was probably a prank, right?

332
00:16:46,140 --> 00:16:47,600
You are a virgin

333
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:48,940
Wait!

334
00:16:49,840 --> 00:16:50,340
Perhaps

335
00:16:50,340 --> 00:16:51,760
you all think him being a professor

336
00:16:51,760 --> 00:16:53,150
is fake too?!

337
00:16:53,580 --> 00:16:54,940
If he says its the truth then its the truth!

338
00:16:54,940 --> 00:16:56,450
why would a professor lie?

339
00:16:56,450 --> 00:16:57,750
You're right

340
00:16:58,050 --> 00:16:59,480
At a time like this receiving such message

341
00:16:59,480 --> 00:17:01,430
it is difficult to believe it is a prank

342
00:17:02,220 --> 00:17:03,320
However

343
00:17:03,320 --> 00:17:04,890
We have to believe a professor!

344
00:17:05,850 --> 00:17:06,690
Ah

345
00:17:06,690 --> 00:17:08,460
I have to go to work

346
00:17:09,090 --> 00:17:11,530
The schedule at the mahjong house is pretty strict

347
00:17:12,430 --> 00:17:14,300
Oh, I am sorry but I am coming over right now

348
00:17:14,300 --> 00:17:16,070
Ok, I'll be leaving first

349
00:17:16,570 --> 00:17:17,970
The point is

350
00:17:17,970 --> 00:17:20,040
we have to work together now!

351
00:17:20,040 --> 00:17:22,340
If we continue like this we might end up as sacrifices

352
00:17:22,340 --> 00:17:24,900
I need to help my team come up with a plan

353
00:17:24,900 --> 00:17:25,360
pass

354
00:17:25,360 --> 00:17:26,000
bye

355
00:17:27,240 --> 00:17:28,000
Pass

356
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:29,630
Then bye

357
00:17:30,910 --> 00:17:32,080
I need to

358
00:17:32,760 --> 00:17:34,760
look after the shop so bye

359
00:17:35,080 --> 00:17:35,550
Why?

360
00:17:35,770 --> 00:17:36,770
I am sorry, Yo-chan

361
00:17:37,550 --> 00:17:39,100
This sounds too scary and ridiculous

362
00:17:39,100 --> 00:17:41,070
I can only move erotic stuff

363
00:17:41,090 --> 00:17:42,360
There's no way I can help you

364
00:17:43,190 --> 00:17:45,890
If you two have time, stop by my shop to have a cup of coffee

365
00:17:46,560 --> 00:17:47,830
Then I'll leave first

366
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:52,100
Crap

367
00:17:52,100 --> 00:17:52,980
What's happening?

368
00:17:52,980 --> 00:17:54,690
What's happening?!

369
00:17:55,840 --> 00:17:56,910
Yoshiro

370
00:17:57,870 --> 00:17:58,540
truthfully

371
00:17:58,690 --> 00:18:00,790
our psychic ability will not be able to help with anything

372
00:18:03,150 --> 00:18:03,710
Bye

373
00:18:06,280 --> 00:18:07,420
Yoshiro

374
00:18:09,220 --> 00:18:10,220
Bye!

375
00:18:11,690 --> 00:18:12,660
Bye!

376
00:18:14,300 --> 00:18:15,330
Bye!

377
00:18:22,700 --> 00:18:24,930
So it seem Asami Takahiro

378
00:18:24,930 --> 00:18:27,300
has many psychics at his side!

379
00:18:27,300 --> 00:18:29,370
if we were to gather and summon them

380
00:18:30,170 --> 00:18:32,210
bond together in the name of friendship?

381
00:18:32,210 --> 00:18:33,610
That's impossible

382
00:18:33,610 --> 00:18:35,440
What do you think will happened then?

383
00:18:35,440 --> 00:18:36,950
They definitely will...

384
00:18:37,210 --> 00:18:39,280
Then we'll throw in a confrontation

385
00:18:44,020 --> 00:18:44,950
Just by tripping over a rock

386
00:18:44,950 --> 00:18:46,660
it will destroy everything!

387
00:18:47,860 --> 00:18:49,090
Yoshiro?

388
00:18:50,760 --> 00:18:52,490
Yoshiro

389
00:18:57,470 --> 00:19:01,070
I really do want to help him

390
00:19:04,770 --> 00:19:06,810
How did it turn out like this today?

391
00:19:07,510 --> 00:19:10,350
So Terumitsu-san and the others never wanted to save the world

392
00:19:11,450 --> 00:19:13,580
This is bad if it continues like this

393
00:19:14,120 --> 00:19:16,390
What do I do so Asami-san's dad will accept me

394
00:19:17,340 --> 00:19:18,700
Mail?

395
00:19:24,130 --> 00:19:25,230
What is this?

396
00:19:26,060 --> 00:19:28,130
Asami-san's kidnapped photo
(Attention to all psychics. The girl is in our hand now )

397
00:19:31,600 --> 00:19:34,000
Kidnapped!

398
00:19:34,970 --> 00:19:35,700
Yoshiro-kun

399
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:37,300
It most possible that it is their doing

400
00:19:37,470 --> 00:19:39,540
It must be the psychics who came here to exterminate other psychics

401
00:19:39,540 --> 00:19:41,140
It seems they have taken notice of us

402
00:19:41,680 --> 00:19:42,980
I'll save her!

403
00:19:43,180 --> 00:19:44,450
Don't act so reckless

404
00:19:44,580 --> 00:19:45,280
We still don't know

405
00:19:45,380 --> 00:19:46,790
anything about them

406
00:19:49,120 --> 00:19:49,620
Yoshiro

407
00:19:50,130 --> 00:19:50,830
Hey!

408
00:19:51,230 --> 00:19:51,930
Yoshiro-kun!

409
00:19:55,420 --> 00:19:56,200
Kidnapped?

410
00:19:56,500 --> 00:19:57,700
It can't be but Sae?!

411
00:20:00,860 --> 00:20:01,530
It seems she been kidnapped

412
00:20:01,830 --> 00:20:03,470
Then we have to hurry up and save her!

413
00:20:05,470 --> 00:20:07,540
But we first have to find someone who can defeat them

414
00:20:08,070 --> 00:20:09,740
But if you say it like this...

415
00:20:10,140 --> 00:20:11,410
We must

416
00:20:12,640 --> 00:20:14,340
protect the world

417
00:20:21,780 --> 00:20:22,690
Miyuki-chan

418
00:20:22,990 --> 00:20:24,120
The voice in your head

419
00:20:24,650 --> 00:20:25,520
I heard it all

420
00:20:26,260 --> 00:20:27,290
Will anyone else come?

421
00:20:27,700 --> 00:20:28,900
I already contacted the professor

422
00:20:29,300 --> 00:20:30,870
I can't reach the others!

423
00:20:30,890 --> 00:20:32,700
If that's the case,

424
00:20:32,700 --> 00:20:33,900
its just us two

425
00:20:33,900 --> 00:20:35,730
who is going to save Asami-san!

426
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:39,320
Asami-san!

427
00:20:39,800 --> 00:20:40,440
Where are you?!

428
00:20:41,040 --> 00:20:42,540
I am here to save you!

429
00:20:47,480 --> 00:20:50,980
I never could have believe you two are actually psychics!

430
00:20:51,350 --> 00:20:52,350
Hayashi

431
00:20:52,850 --> 00:20:54,250
and you too Natsume

432
00:20:55,080 --> 00:20:56,120
Hayashi sensei

433
00:20:56,120 --> 00:20:57,090
give up now!

434
00:20:57,120 --> 00:20:58,300
Let Asami-san go!

435
00:20:59,760 --> 00:21:01,790
If you two can win against us then we'll discuss it

436
00:21:01,790 --> 00:21:03,000
Perverted sensei!

437
00:21:03,390 --> 00:21:04,630
Super wind!

438
00:21:07,260 --> 00:21:08,800
Such a pretty blow

439
00:21:10,100 --> 00:21:11,300
This is not the time to be having an erection!

440
00:21:12,070 --> 00:21:12,740
Fuck

441
00:21:14,070 --> 00:21:15,470
What's wrong with you?

442
00:21:16,640 --> 00:21:19,300
Penis!

443
00:21:19,300 --> 00:21:20,380
It hurts!

444
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:22,610
Do you see?

445
00:21:22,610 --> 00:21:24,280
This is our psychic power

446
00:21:25,780 --> 00:21:26,350
I can

447
00:21:26,790 --> 00:21:27,790
create the wind

448
00:21:28,750 --> 00:21:30,220
And Natsume's sensei

449
00:21:30,820 --> 00:21:34,000
can grab onto a guy's penis!

450
00:21:36,060 --> 00:21:41,000
Therefore last time with Yasu's penis, it was Natsume sensei too

451
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:43,800
Sorry I beat you quickly

452
00:21:45,100 --> 00:21:46,370
This feels so good

453
00:21:47,670 --> 00:21:48,370
So wasteful...

454
00:21:48,870 --> 00:21:49,310
Miyuki-chan!

455
00:21:49,310 --> 00:21:50,040
What are we going to do?

456
00:21:50,340 --> 00:21:51,200
If we continue like this

457
00:21:51,300 --> 00:21:53,660
how we are going to save Asami?

458
00:21:54,040 --> 00:21:54,350
But

459
00:21:54,620 --> 00:21:56,620
we can only hear other people's thoughts

460
00:21:58,510 --> 00:22:00,080
The only thing we can do now is fight with our hands

461
00:22:01,650 --> 00:22:02,890
Yoshiro-kun!

462
00:22:04,150 --> 00:22:05,590
Yo-chan we are here to save you!

463
00:22:05,760 --> 00:22:06,660
Professor!

464
00:22:06,830 --> 00:22:07,330
Everyone!

465
00:22:07,860 --> 00:22:10,090
We are here so you don't have to worry anymore!

466
00:22:10,490 --> 00:22:11,890
Is this a joke!?

467
00:22:12,130 --> 00:22:14,100
Earlier didn't you all said you don't care

468
00:22:14,100 --> 00:22:15,630
We have to work together

469
00:22:15,630 --> 00:22:17,030
to save the world!

470
00:22:17,870 --> 00:22:19,600
How can I possibly say that but then again it's the only way to save Yo-chan,

471
00:22:19,600 --> 00:22:20,770
the only way to get to her breasts

472
00:22:21,070 --> 00:22:22,270
breast milk

473
00:22:22,300 --> 00:22:23,000
hot breast milk

474
00:22:23,270 --> 00:22:24,370
Dutch dairy

475
00:22:24,640 --> 00:22:26,040
You guys can't be save

476
00:22:26,480 --> 00:22:27,640
Let's go!

477
00:22:28,380 --> 00:22:29,300
Team

478
00:22:29,300 --> 00:22:30,500
psychics!

479
00:22:34,850 --> 00:22:36,190
Penis!

480
00:22:36,190 --> 00:22:37,700
Let me have a bite!

481
00:22:37,700 --> 00:22:40,300
I see underwear!

482
00:22:42,220 --> 00:22:43,860
Penis!

483
00:22:44,490 --> 00:22:45,730
This place is?

484
00:22:50,770 --> 00:22:52,100
The kidnappers place

485
00:22:59,680 --> 00:23:01,040
What's going on?

486
00:23:33,410 --> 00:23:34,040
Asami-san!

487
00:23:35,480 --> 00:23:36,680
Kamogawa-kun

488
00:23:37,510 --> 00:23:38,500
It's okay

489
00:23:38,780 --> 00:23:39,780
Don't worry

490
00:23:40,520 --> 00:23:41,350
I am here

491
00:23:41,420 --> 00:23:42,620
to save you!

492
00:23:48,060 --> 00:23:48,660
Asami-san

493
00:23:49,300 --> 00:23:50,300
is fine!

494
00:23:50,890 --> 00:23:51,370
That's good

495
00:23:52,100 --> 00:23:52,600
Sae!

496
00:23:55,130 --> 00:23:56,130
Are you okay?

497
00:23:58,470 --> 00:23:59,540
Father

498
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:03,540
Professor, you're her father?

499
00:24:04,640 --> 00:24:05,480
Father

500
00:24:06,540 --> 00:24:07,400
I...

501
00:24:10,210 --> 00:24:11,750
How many times did I tell you

502
00:24:13,050 --> 00:24:14,380
you have to be careful when you leave the doors

503
00:24:18,690 --> 00:24:19,300
Sorry

504
00:24:26,100 --> 00:24:27,300
because of my daughter

505
00:24:28,260 --> 00:24:30,270
everyone was put in danger

506
00:24:30,870 --> 00:24:32,330
However, like this too all of you now understands

507
00:24:33,370 --> 00:24:35,370
We are being threaten by a power

508
00:24:36,740 --> 00:24:38,570
that wishes to destroy psychics

509
00:24:39,880 --> 00:24:41,780
In the future we will be face with an even stronger power

510
00:24:42,380 --> 00:24:46,050
who has a lust to make the waking state become evil

511
00:24:47,080 --> 00:24:48,120
Those two are probably

512
00:24:48,550 --> 00:24:49,900
the transfer teachers from their side

513
00:24:50,350 --> 00:24:51,450
I am only a  life guidance teacher

514
00:24:51,450 --> 00:24:52,790
Shut up!

515
00:24:57,190 --> 00:24:58,960
Psychics have a mutual attraction toward each other

516
00:24:59,800 --> 00:25:00,370
That is why

517
00:25:00,760 --> 00:25:02,760
psychics will appears in front of us again

518
00:25:05,100 --> 00:25:06,270
We can't afford to

519
00:25:06,970 --> 00:25:07,970
let what happened to Dultch happen to us!

520
00:25:09,270 --> 00:25:10,910
The true plan starts now!

521
00:25:12,570 --> 00:25:14,300
It isn't a time to run away

522
00:25:14,980 --> 00:25:17,410
I also don't want to see myself get kill

523
00:25:19,620 --> 00:25:21,320
Actually

524
00:25:21,550 --> 00:25:22,850
that was well said

525
00:25:22,850 --> 00:25:26,300
But first we must be able to touch the assistant's breasts before discussing this again, right?

526
00:25:27,060 --> 00:25:28,050
You're right

527
00:25:31,790 --> 00:25:33,730
What do you mean true plan?

528
00:25:36,330 --> 00:25:37,630
psychics?

529
00:25:38,900 --> 00:25:39,970
You are all crazy?

530
00:25:40,770 --> 00:25:42,500
How could such thing exists!

531
00:25:42,500 --> 00:25:44,910
You are all nothing but a group of perverts!

532
00:25:45,370 --> 00:25:46,850
Wandering eyes while jerking off boy!

533
00:25:46,850 --> 00:25:48,010
A prostitute!

534
00:25:48,010 --> 00:25:49,210
The coffee shop pervert!

535
00:25:49,750 --> 00:25:51,280
You're a good-for-nothing shorty!

536
00:25:51,580 --> 00:25:53,480
The world does not need such abnormal perverts!

537
00:25:54,080 --> 00:25:55,720
What are you saying, we saved you!

538
00:25:55,720 --> 00:25:57,120
Don't come over slut!

539
00:25:58,520 --> 00:26:01,760
How could you put me in such a position, and in a ghost town like this?

540
00:26:02,930 --> 00:26:04,960
Tetsuya never contacted me once

541
00:26:05,690 --> 00:26:08,460
The school are full of weird people I don't care about!

542
00:26:09,370 --> 00:26:11,630
All of father's excuses is just his research

543
00:26:12,470 --> 00:26:15,000
Because of all you, my life has turned upside down!

544
00:26:18,810 --> 00:26:20,810
On mother's death bed

545
00:26:21,640 --> 00:26:25,180
because you were absorbed in these stupid psychic matters you didn't come back on time

546
00:26:28,050 --> 00:26:30,920
Actually have you ever though of us as your family?

547
00:26:33,990 --> 00:26:36,030
You are all crazy!

548
00:26:40,930 --> 00:26:42,130
Asami-san

549
00:26:55,780 --> 00:26:56,880
It's almost time

550
00:26:57,300 --> 00:26:58,710
Professor Asami

551
00:27:02,020 --> 00:27:03,050
In this town

552
00:27:03,610 --> 00:27:04,800
the psychic...

553
00:27:22,600 --> 00:27:23,410
What's wrong?

554
00:27:25,570 --> 00:27:26,640
Get lost

555
00:27:27,380 --> 00:27:28,780
What's the matter?

556
00:27:29,240 --> 00:27:29,600
Ah...

557
00:27:30,070 --> 00:27:31,670
You accumulated too much and need to release
