{1756}{1801}F You try to get a read on the wind i
{1801}{1861}F Out in the middle of nowhere i
{1861}{1929}F Where's your racing heart trying to lead you? i
{1929}{2006}F Hang in there, it's only natural to hesitate i
{2006}{2060}F But a prize that anyone can get their hands on i
{2060}{2119}F Doesn't mean anything at all i
{2119}{2178}F This long journey will take every last drop i
{2178}{2235}F Of your blood, sweat, and tears i
{2235}{2352}F As your cowardice sways you i
{2352}{2464}F Don't jump to conclusions i
{2464}{2576}F Put the pedal to the metal and make it to the top i
{2576}{2692}F Let the weak flame in your heart fuel you i
{2692}{2806}F As your cowardice tears you apart i
{2806}{2924}F Don't falter even if your body is ripped to shreds i
{2924}{3033}F Be the first to the top i
{3033}{3149}F Set your heart aflame i
{3149}{3213}F Let your legs roar i
{3213}{3261}F And make it past the summit i
{3261}{3337}F With that weak flame of yours i

{7015}{7089}Manami a Kuroda udrûuj˙ svoje tempo.
{7089}{7144}Nevyr˙tili sa hneÔ za br·nou.
{7159}{7220}Kuroda sa pripravoval na tento deÚ.
{7238}{7272}Je v perfektnej kondÌcii.
{7282}{7373}KeÔ uû hovorÌme o vrch·roch, s˙ ako ja.

{8094}{8166}Nepredstieraj, ûe ste ma nepoËul!
{8433}{8482}Kuroda sa ho pok˙öa striasù.
{8511}{8570}SnaûÌ sa si vybudovaù vedenie pri zjazde.
{8668}{8703}Manamiho to niako nevzruöuje.
{8722}{8765}Je to Ëasù jeho stratÈgie?
{8782}{8830}Vyzve ho keÔ zaËne st˙panie?
{8837}{8881}Manami nereaguje.
{8881}{8942}MusÌ ho vyzvaù pri st˙panii!
{8942}{8985}Sklapni, Toudou.
{9368}{9417}Dostali sa k st˙paniu.
{9417}{9469}Kuroda uû nie je v dohæade.
{9469}{9531}Rozdiel medzi nimi je jeden - nie, dve min˙ty.
{9551}{9615}Zost·va desaù kilometrov. »o urobÌö, Manami?

{10515}{10617}Ak vyhr· Manami, stane sa prv˝ prv·kom Hakone Academy |ktor˝ sa ich z˙Ëastni.
{10676}{10763}Sangaku, kedy si sa stal tak ˙ûasn˝m?
{10789}{10835}B˝val si tak...

{19074}{19182}Kuroda si vybral svoju zruËnosù vrch·ra na ktor˙ sa zamriava|vÔaka sk˙senostiam.
{19481}{19560}Kuroda je siln˝ vrch·r.

{19642}{19682}Jeho tanec je tieû efektÌvny.
{19703}{19730}Ale...
{19739}{19822}Je mi to æ˙to, ale pravdepodobne v·s predbehnem na Ôalöej rovine.
{19852}{19904}»o to je, nejak· hra?
{19904}{19934}To na mna nebude fungovaù!
{19964}{19990}Kuroda urobil svoj ùah!

{21023}{21103}Som na ûive.
{21119}{21187}Na chvÌæu som videl krÌdæa...
{21203}{21303}On naËasoval svoj ˙tok s vetrom a zr˝chlil.
{21338}{21417}Kuroda si to vöimol prÌliö neskoro a tak ho zanechal za sebou.
{21494}{21534}Som z Cycling Monthly.
{21534}{21570}Ako sa cÌtiö?
{21570}{21645}Fukutomi, ktor˙ ökolu povaûujete za svojho s˙pera?
{21662}{21738}Dnes sme si vybrali öiestÈho Ëlena.

{22077}{22141}Teraz mÙûem Ìsù na Interhigh.
{22160}{22228}ZaujÌmalo by ma, Ëi znova uvidÌm Sakamichiho.
{22507}{22538}Len to poË˙vaj!
{22538}{22586}To je ˙ûasnÈ!
{22613}{22651}Je to ˙plne norm·lne.

{26208}{26284}CestnÈ preteky je boj proti ceste.
{26284}{26361}A to nie je maratÛn, je to Road Relay.
{26374}{26419}Huh? Road Realy?
{26429}{26474}Hakone Road Relay.
{26474}{26556}Nahr·val som to na Nov˝ rok.
{26556}{26722}Vysokoökolsk˝ maratÛn v Hakone je vysielan˝ 2. a 3. janu·ra.
{26722}{26756}Hakone...
{26756}{26834}Toto je z·znam ötvrtÈho a piatÈho beûca na Hakonskom Road Relay.
{26834}{26990}Na Interhigh pÙjdeme presne ten ist˝ kurz na bicykloch.
{27049}{27104}Chcete, aby sme si naötudovali trasu?
{27119}{27198}BlÌûia sa k svahu s 6% sklonom.
{27209}{27310}Za tunelom Hakone leûÌ|najbrut·lnejöia Ëasù kurzu.
{27417}{27498}»o si myslÌte? Hakone je n·roËn˝ kurz.
{27498}{27563}Po prejdenÌ Odawary,
{27563}{27678}prÌde n·hle st˙panie o 834 metrov nad more..
{27691}{27757}Cesta je star· a ˙zka.
{27757}{27825}Je tam mal· viditeænosù, takûe je ùaûkÈ pos˙diù podmienky.
{27839}{27924}Ale musÌme bojovaù pri st˙panÌ.
{27938}{28093}DeravÈ pneumatiky, problÈmy s vybavenÌm,|vyËerpanÈ z·soby, strmÈ svahy, vietor ...
{28093}{28208}Za t˝chto podmienok musÌme jazdiù celÈ hodiny
{28208}{28342}pod letn˝m slnkom, zatiaæ Ëo bojujeme proti naöim s˙perom.
{28423}{28495}Poznaù kurzu je dÙleûitÈ.
{28508}{28588}Vr·tane Hakone Academy, bojujeme proti dvadsiatim ökol·m.
{28601}{28655}So öiestimi Ëlenmi v kaûdom tÌme,
{28682}{28721}Ëo robÌ 120 ÔalöÌch pretek·rov.
{28771}{28830}Takûe m·me 120 protivnÌkov.
{28830}{28886}Neexistuje ûiadny in˝ öport ako je tento.
{28901}{28994}Doteraz som pretekal proti ötyrom alebo piatim æuÔom.
{28994}{29052}NemÙûem zvl·dnuù 120 naraz!
{29067}{29153}Nielen to, ale s˙ to pretek·ri z dvaciatich najlepöÌch ökÙl v Japonsku.
{29153}{29186}Uû teraz ch·peö?
{29186}{29274}Je to dlh· cesta na vrchol.
{29368}{29448}A-Ale budeme v pohode tak dlho|k˝m kaûd˝ bude robiù to najlepöie, ûe?
{29467}{29484}Nie.
{29519}{29549}PreËo nie?|
{29569}{29593}To nie je dosù.
{29593}{29621}PreËo?
{29866}{29929}Interhigh trv· tri dni.
{29929}{29972}Je to trojdÚov˝ z·vod.
{29972}{30014}Hakone je prv˝ deÚ.
{30014}{30087}Ak vyËerp·te vöetku svoju silu v prv˝ deÚ nebudeteö vl·daù.
{30115}{30147}Tri dni...
{30167}{30252}Pri jazde si budete musÌeù öetriù silu.
{30252}{30339}Ak si zvolÌe pomalÈ tempo alebo to preûeniete,
{30339}{30392}padnete a zranÌte sa ...
{30392}{30513}rovnako ako Fukutomi proti Hakone akadÈmii minul˝ rok |na z·vode v Hiroöime.
{30569}{30676}Kinjou sa ho chytil a padol tieû..
{30977}{30977}
{31207}{31316}Summer tries to melt our bodies away
{31316}{31428}The wind envelopes the beating of our hearts
{31428}{31483}The sound of our wheels
{31483}{31556}Marks the scenery we leave in our wake
{31556}{31656}The world is full of moments like these
{31656}{31698}I'm ready
{31698}{31777}Whether we want to stop or keep going
{31777}{31880}It's up to us to decide
{31880}{32083}While the crazy flow of time may leave us in its dust
{32098}{32159}We can't take it lying down
{32159}{32265}Your wholehearted plea
